Sorry, for some reason I though I read a line that set delayed_status to 
0 in composite_setup().  I must have been fantasizing...

Yes.  The composite core does not abort the current transfer/operation 
when a new Setup transaction occurs.  But it should -- and it should set 
delayed_status back to 0.  (Maybe this is what I was fantasizing.)

That sounds reasonable.

This is why I think we will need to change the API.  There has to be a 
way to tell usb_composite_setup_continue() which SETUP it is being 
called for.  A new SETUP or a disconnect should invalidate the old 
SETUP, and then usb_composite_setup_continue() would ignore any calls 
that were for the old SETUP packet.
