The problem is that we can't now reuse or share if necessary, or just
in general be in charge of the lifetime of the software nodes because
that call is in device_del(). Now the lifetime of the software nodes
is always tied to the devices they are attached, no questions asked.

Sure thing. Thanks Rafael.
