Got it.  I don't believe f_eem will use a high enough (if at all)
bMaxBurst value to change the TXFIFO size.

:), not a problem...I've been working on getting the ideal set up for
the performance profiling for awhile, so anything I can do to make sure
we get some good results.

Thanks again for the testing, Ferry.
