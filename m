Above you wrote: "the USB device continuous send interrupt signal to 
system".  But that's not correct.  The interrupt signals are sent by the 
USB host controller, not by the USB audio device.

The patch description should mention that this happens only with some 
Synopsys host controllers.

Yes.  But ehci_bus_suspend() runs _before_ the host controller is 
suspended.  While ehci_bus_suspend() is running, usb_hcd_irq() _will_ 
call ehci_irq(), and ehci_irq() _will_ clear the status bits.

After the host controller is suspended it is not supposed to generate 
any interrupt signals at all, because ehci_suspend() writes 0 to the 
USBINTR register, and it does this _before_ clearing 
HCD_FLAG_HW_ACCESSIBLE.

STS_FLR is not set in the USBINTR register, but STS_IAA is.  So that's 
the one which matters.

Clearing the STS_IAA flag won't hurt, no matter who manufactured the 
controller.  So your patch should look more like this:

+	/* Some Synopsys controllers mistakenly leave IAA turned on */
+	ehci_writel(ehci, STS_IAA, &ehci->regs->status);

And these lines should come before the "Any IAA cycle..." comment line.
Does that fix the problem?
