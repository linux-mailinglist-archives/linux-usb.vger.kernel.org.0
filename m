Wait, usb_device_driver shouldn't be used here, that's only for
"special" things like hubs and an odd Apple device.

Interfaces are bound to usb_driver, and are a child device of a struct
usb_device.  There is no need to worry if a driver is bound to a struct
usb_device at any time, it should be independent if a driver is bound to
a struct interface.  All that we should care about is the driver that is
bound to a usb_interface as that is what the rust binding should be for
here.

Sorry for the naming confusion, usb is messy in places.
