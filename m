I am a bit unclear - not sure if we have gone full circle on this
subject. what is then the direction to get this merged?

I did have look last week and the level of effort to support regulators
on external nodes is not neglectable meaning that I might not have the
time to deliver that feature (perhaps someone else wishes to take over?)
