It is undoubtedly a hardware issue.  The dmesg extract shows that ports 
1-10, 1-11, and 2-5 (which is probably the same port as one of the 
others) have overcurrent conditions; I'm guessing that these are the 
ports which have external connections.

What were the devices Dirk plugged in that got rid of the kworker 
processes?  In particular, were they USB-2 or USB-3?  (The dmesg log for 
when the devices were first attached can answer these questions.)

As far as I know, there is no way for the kernel to work around this 
problem.  Preventing the controller from going into runtime suspend is 
probably the best solution.

Perhaps Mathias (the xhci-hcd maintainer) will have more suggestions.
