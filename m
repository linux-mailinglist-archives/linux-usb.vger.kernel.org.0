Fine, then I was more conservative on adding comments than you; we will 
see if other maintainers accept adding such comments as well for further 
findings we will encounter.

I cannot yet say if some annotation would work, we, Sudip and me, need to 
investigate. It could be that something like, assert(!IS_ERR(tt)), is 
sufficient to let the tools know that they can safely assume that the 
path they are complaining about is not possible.

We could make the assert() a nop, so it would not effect the resulting 
object code in any way.

We have not tried that; We are still experimenting with clang analyzer 
and are still learning.
