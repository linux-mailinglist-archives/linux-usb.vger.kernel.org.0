That is actually a clever way to solve that problem.

You can always provide a PCIe device representation within the Device
Tree, this is not very common, but it is sometimes useful for e.g.:
assigning MAC addresses, see this example for instance:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6qdl-zii-rdu2.dtsi#n647

(does not assign a MAC address, but it could). This should allow your
XHCI pci_device::of_node pointer to point to node declared in the Device
Tree. There you could add a 'resets' property accordingly.

It seems to me this is not usually necessary for PC systems, so it was
not really needed until now. Maybe you can write a small wrapper around
xhci-pci.c, similar to what xhci-plat.c does which is responsible for
grabbing and releasing the reset.
