Subject: [PATCH v4 0/5] USB DWC3 host wake up support from system suspend
Date:   Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:07:58 +0530
Message-Id: <1603831083-2025-1-git-send-email-sanm@codeaurora.org>

List-ID: <linux-usb.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-usb@vger.kernel.org

Avoiding phy powerdown in host mode so that it can be wake up by devices.
Set GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag to keep usb30_prim gdsc active
when wakeup capable devices are connected to the host.
Using PDC interrupts instead of GIC interrupst to support wakeup in
xo shutdown case.

Changes in v4:
Addressed Matthias comments raised in v3.

Changes in v3:
Removed need_phy_for_wakeup flag and by default avoiding phy powerdown.
Addressed Matthias comments and added entry for DEV_SUPERSPEED.
Added suspend_quirk in dwc3 host and moved the dwc3_set_phy_speed_flags.
Added wakeup-source dt entry and reading in dwc-qcom.c glue driver.

Changes in v2:
Dropped the patch in clock to set GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag and 
setting in usb dwc3 driver.
Separated the core patch and glue driver patch.
Made need_phy_for_wakeup flag part of dwc structure and 
hs_phy_flags as unsgined int.
Adrressed the comment on device_init_wakeup call.
Corrected offset for reading portsc register.
Added pacth to support wakeup in xo shutdown case.
