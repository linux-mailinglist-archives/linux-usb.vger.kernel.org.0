Oh, I chose to handle this in vhci_urb_enqueue() as it seemed to be the only
place where vdev->udev gets assigned.  Now I wonder if that assignment
should really be here, but probably I'm missing something obvious as I'm
still in the process of getting familiar with the code base.

I've only addressed usbip_vhci suspend prevention at the moment, as that was
supposed to work.

This only handles the client side, i.e. the virtually attached devices,
hence I didn't pay much attention to undo the syscore thing (wasn't
straightforward to accomplish via the URB handling path anyway).  I'll
definitely fix this up by moving to rh_port_[dis]connect(), as Shuah
suggested.

Indeed, will document this.

Yes, this is managed by core PM infra which basically skips processing of
any PM callbacks when the flag is set - e.g. see how dev->power.syscore is
handled in device_suspend():

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/base/power/main.c?h=v6.16-rc6#n1800

>> What about runtime suspend?  

I think that's a slightly different topic - so far I've been only focused on
system suspend.

As mentioned above, the target for now is to unbreak the system suspend
prevention on the client side.  The server side doesn't seem to support it.

Hmm, I might need to improve the description in this case, as I only
mentioned VHCI and the virtual hub/ports, hence I was referring to the
client side only.

Please check the link above.

Right, I was actually looking into having a proper suspend/resume support
rather than just preventing it on the client side (for now), but that's
clearly not an easy task to accomplish, as it requires extending the USP/IP
protocol and most probably also the user space tools.

That's understandable, but currently vhci_hcd is supposed to prevent
suspend, which mostly works but it's unreliable, hence my initial goal was
to provide a simple fix for it before attempting to experiment with more
invasive changes.

Thank you both for the initial feedback!
