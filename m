Okay.  In that case, xhci-hcd should appear to act just like a USB-2 
host controller.

No, it isn't.

This could be a bug in xhci-hcd.  Perhaps the controller's endpoint 
state needs to be updated after one of these errors occurs.  Mathias 
will know all about that.

The device won't send any data unless the host controller tells it to.  
If something is wrong with the host controller then usbmon won't see any 
data.
