You can send patches to rename the new-source-frq-typec-current property 
into frs-new-source-opmode, and update the tcpm as well. You can use the 
typec_find_pwr_opmode(), it will return
enum typec_pwr_opmode {
	TYPEC_PWR_MODE_USB,
	TYPEC_PWR_MODE_1_5A,
	TYPEC_PWR_MODE_3_0A,
	TYPEC_PWR_MODE_PD,
};
Then you have to translate it for FRS.

I'll send a new version of my series to document typec-power-opmode and 
update stusb160x driver and stm32mp15xx-dkx device tree accordingly.

Thanks,
Amelie
