It looks like bluez invokes hci_dev_do_close. This gracefully clears
any packets in flight, clears any pending actions and disables the
device as a wakeup source (which for Realtek allows it to enter global
suspend). This is approximately what I was trying to achieve.

I think I'll abandon this patch series. The general sentiment seems to
be "don't do this" and it looks like closing the hci device is better
in my case.

Thanks for the feedback and pointing me this way.
