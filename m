The device claims to be able to signal PME from D0 (this is from the lspci
in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203673):

  00:10.0 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] FCH USB XHCI Controller (rev 20) (prog-if 30 [XHCI])
    Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 3
      Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1- D2- AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0+,D1-,D2-,D3hot+,D3cold+)

From the xHCI spec r1.0, sec 4.15.2.3, it looks like a connect
detected while in D0 should assert PME# if enabled (and WCE is set).

Kai did say nothing happens when hot-adding a USB device, so I think
there really is a problem.  This should be an obvious problem that
lots of people would trip over, so I expect there should be reports in
launchpad, etc.  I'd really like to have those bread crumbs.  Kai, can
you add a complete dmesg log to the bugzilla?  Hints from the log,
like the platform name, can help find related reports.

I didn't understand this part.  From a PCI perspective, PME signaling
while in D0 is an optional feature and should work if the device
advertises support for it.  If it doesn't work on this device, we
should have a quirk to indicate that.

But I thought Kai said the device *can* signal PME from D0, but for
some reason we don't handle it correctly if we have called the xHCI
suspend callback.

That's the part I don't understand.  Is this an xHCI driver issue?
Should the suspend callback do something different if we're staying in
D0?  I'm not sure the callback even knows what Dx state we're going
to.
