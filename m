But it's already there by absent put/get callbacks. On fwnode level it
is like you described. So, talking for a good pattern we have to call
the fwnode_handle_put() independently and always for for_each_child
and get_next_child usages.

Yes, it's only ACPI that survives w/o reference counting.

Overlays. Not for ever.

ACPI overlays are quite used (at least by two people I know and a few
more that asked questions about them here and there), but luckily it
doesn't require refcounting (yet?).

And is it good to provoke all kinds of tools (kmemleak, *SANs, etc)? I
do not think so. If we are writing good code it should be good enough.

Which is good. Then we will discover real issues.

I tend to disagree with you. How in this case we can go below 0 in
case we know that we took a counter? If somewhere else the code will
do that, it is a problem that has to be fixed on case-by-case basis.

It's consistent now independently of the beneath layer from fwnode API p.o.=
v.
