Hi All,

I am seeing a peculiar behaviour which I think *might* beÂ 
caused by usb_new_device(). Since usb_new_device() is one of the core
APIs, I cannot explain how PM works for USB device at later point in
time.

In a particular use-case, our composite USB device
exposes HID interface with vendor report descriptor. Since the standard
HID-class driver's HID-input part is unable to decode this vendor report
descriptor, it is unable to bind itself to this interface.
After this, we don't see any L2 requests on USB bus analyser.
Obvious reason seems to be, since no driver is bound to interface, there
cannot be PM call-backs since driver has these call-backs.

But I am expecting that the USB device (which is parent of HID
interface) should see L2. The reason being, USB-core seems to properly
do runtime get/put wherever needed. And HID interface has no driver, so
from USB-core point of view, it is a USB device w/o any interface.
(please correct if this is incorrect expectation).

With that said, I am confused about usb_new_device() in this context. It
seems to call usb_disable_autosuspend() ==> pm_runtime_forbid() ==>
increment usage_count.
However, it never calls usb_enable_autosuspend() itself.
Now since USB PM (and L2) works fine at later point in time (i.e.: after
all the interfaces are bound to their appropriate drivers), I think
somewhere the equivalent of usb_enable_autosuspend() gets called for the
USB device and hence USB PM works fine.

I wonder this *may be* be an issue I am seeing with the use-case
mentioned above. But definitely confused about it and hence thought of
sending this email.

Does this description makes sense? Is it necessary to
call usb_enable_autosuspend() in usb_new_device()?

Thanks,
