   448	/*
   449	 * For use with the TRACE_EVENT macro:
   450	 *
   451	 * We define a tracepoint, its arguments, its printk format
   452	 * and its 'fast binary record' layout.
   453	 *
   454	 * Firstly, name your tracepoint via TRACE_EVENT(name : the
   455	 * 'subsystem_event' notation is fine.
   456	 *
   457	 * Think about this whole construct as the
   458	 * 'trace_sched_switch() function' from now on.
   459	 *
   460	 *
   461	 *  TRACE_EVENT(sched_switch,
   462	 *
   463	 *	*
   464	 *	* A function has a regular function arguments
   465	 *	* prototype, declare it via TP_PROTO():
   466	 *	*
   467	 *
   468	 *	TP_PROTO(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *prev,
   469	 *		 struct task_struct *next),
   470	 *
   471	 *	*
   472	 *	* Define the call signature of the 'function'.
   473	 *	* (Design sidenote: we use this instead of a
   474	 *	*  TP_PROTO1/TP_PROTO2/TP_PROTO3 ugliness.)
   475	 *	*
   476	 *
   477	 *	TP_ARGS(rq, prev, next),
   478	 *
   479	 *	*
   480	 *	* Fast binary tracing: define the trace record via
   481	 *	* TP_STRUCT__entry(). You can think about it like a
   482	 *	* regular C structure local variable definition.
   483	 *	*
   484	 *	* This is how the trace record is structured and will
   485	 *	* be saved into the ring buffer. These are the fields
   486	 *	* that will be exposed to user-space in
   487	 *	* /sys/kernel/tracing/events/<*>/format.
   488	 *	*
   489	 *	* The declared 'local variable' is called '__entry'
   490	 *	*
   491	 *	* __field(pid_t, prev_pid) is equivalent to a standard declaration:
   492	 *	*
   493	 *	*	pid_t	prev_pid;
   494	 *	*
   495	 *	* __array(char, prev_comm, TASK_COMM_LEN) is equivalent to:
   496	 *	*
   497	 *	*	char	prev_comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];
   498	 *	*
   499	 *
   500	 *	TP_STRUCT__entry(
   501	 *		__array(	char,	prev_comm,	TASK_COMM_LEN	)
   502	 *		__field(	pid_t,	prev_pid			)
   503	 *		__field(	int,	prev_prio			)
   504	 *		__array(	char,	next_comm,	TASK_COMM_LEN	)
   505	 *		__field(	pid_t,	next_pid			)
   506	 *		__field(	int,	next_prio			)
   507	 *	),
   508	 *
   509	 *	*
   510	 *	* Assign the entry into the trace record, by embedding
   511	 *	* a full C statement block into TP_fast_assign(). You
   512	 *	* can refer to the trace record as '__entry' -
   513	 *	* otherwise you can put arbitrary C code in here.
   514	 *	*
   515	 *	* Note: this C code will execute every time a trace event
   516	 *	* happens, on an active tracepoint.
   517	 *	*
   518	 *
   519	 *	TP_fast_assign(
   520	 *		memcpy(__entry->next_comm, next->comm, TASK_COMM_LEN);
   521	 *		__entry->prev_pid	= prev->pid;
   522	 *		__entry->prev_prio	= prev->prio;
   523	 *		memcpy(__entry->prev_comm, prev->comm, TASK_COMM_LEN);
   524	 *		__entry->next_pid	= next->pid;
   525	 *		__entry->next_prio	= next->prio;
   526	 *	),
   527	 *
   528	 *	*
   529	 *	* Formatted output of a trace record via TP_printk().
   530	 *	* This is how the tracepoint will appear under ftrace
   531	 *	* plugins that make use of this tracepoint.
   532	 *	*
   533	 *	* (raw-binary tracing wont actually perform this step.)
   534	 *	*
   535	 *
   536	 *	TP_printk("task %s:%d [%d] ==> %s:%d [%d]",
   537	 *		__entry->prev_comm, __entry->prev_pid, __entry->prev_prio,
   538	 *		__entry->next_comm, __entry->next_pid, __entry->next_prio),
   539	 *
   540	 * );
   541	 *
   542	 * This macro construct is thus used for the regular printk format
   543	 * tracing setup, it is used to construct a function pointer based
   544	 * tracepoint callback (this is used by programmatic plugins and
   545	 * can also by used by generic instrumentation like SystemTap), and
   546	 * it is also used to expose a structured trace record in
   547	 * /sys/kernel/tracing/events/.
   548	 *
   549	 * A set of (un)registration functions can be passed to the variant
   550	 * TRACE_EVENT_FN to perform any (un)registration work.
