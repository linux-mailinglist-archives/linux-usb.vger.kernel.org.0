fair enough :-)

That's true.

Unfortunately, not off the top of my head.

No, no. USBCV doesn't have tests for this. Lecroy's Test Suite was more
extensive than USBCV. I was simply saying that changes to ep0 (and any
of the low level control pipe handling) should be done with care to make
sure we don't break certification for folks who'd like to pursue that
route.

Understood. Do you have sample traces showing this case?
