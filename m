Another thing...

It's not clear that the patch will fix the problem entirely.  Your 
original analysis of the bug stated:

My patch removes the locking issue.  But if an execution path can 
occur with a lock present, it can also occur when the lock has been 
removed.  That means it may still be possible for the UVC gadget driver 
to try deactivating the UDC after the unbind process has finished or for 
it to try cleaning up a V4L2 node that has been purged.

If either of those really could have happened (as opposed to just 
getting stuck in a deadlock, waiting for a mutex that would never be 
released), then it can still happen with the patch.  Fixing them would 
require changes to the UVC gadget driver.  So the problem may not be 
gone entirely.
