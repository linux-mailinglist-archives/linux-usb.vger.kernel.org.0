It's really up to what we want, and how we you guys want to implement
it. If the mode selection was a device (associated with each port (or
partner) for example), then maybe the "set" could be a driver attached
to it. Maybe :)

I'm just asking that we isolate the feature, because I think it can be
separated in this case. I think isolating it should give some
flexibility on things like where the control is in the end, but more
importantly, that should minimise the impact to the existing bits and
pieces, maybe allow the feature to be selectable, etc. etc.

thanks,
