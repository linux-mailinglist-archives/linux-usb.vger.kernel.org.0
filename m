Yep, that one happens when the driver tries to reset the device. We
need to catch the error earlier in order to avoid the 10s wait.

Ah, good point. The in-flight interrupt URB responsible of retrieving
the event from the device will fail. It should be sufficient to inject
a hardware error event at that point in order to fix this.

As such, a simple solution may be to call hci_reset_dev from inside
btusb_intr_complete and btusb_submit_intr_urb when the URB submission
fails (for "err !=3D -EPERM").
