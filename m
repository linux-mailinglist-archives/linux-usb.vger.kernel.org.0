Ok, good. I thought you said some QUSB2 platforms used DP/DM, but I guess
that means they don't have the qusb2_phy interrupt then.

Please do. The driver polls the corresponding status register on all
platforms currently, and perhaps this interrupt can one day be used to
get rid of the polling.

As I mentioned elsewhere, it depends on whether it can be used at all.
Not simply whether there is some other mechanism that can be used in its
stead. Such a decision should be left up to the implementation.

That's why I said "truly unusable" above. It's still not clear to me
whether that is the case or not.

No, we should avoid that if we can as with two many optional things,
these quickly gets messy (one optional interrupt at the end is fine and
can be expressed using min/maxItems).

If the "qusb2+" combination above isn't needed, then we're down to four
permutations, which is few enough to be spelled out explicitly even if
we decide that the hs_phy_irq should be kept in. Without hs_phy_irq, it
seems there's really only two permutations.
