I agree, this should be fixed if we can.  I'm still puzzled about how 
commits you located could cause any difference in the device's behavior, 
given that they don't seem to cause any change's to the computer's 
behavior.

Good.  I've been quite busy recently, but I'll look at the logs when 
there is time.

The USB-2 and USB-3 drivers do share some initialization code, but not 
all of it.  The first couple of steps are quite different: With a USB-2 
controller they are handled by the kernel driver, but with a USB-3 
controller they are handled directly by the controller's hardware with 
no software influence.
