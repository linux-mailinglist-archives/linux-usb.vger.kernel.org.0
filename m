Urbs really aren't all that large of a "resource", so don't worry about
that.  Get it working properly first before attempting to care about
small buffers like this :)

That's odd, why use NULL for a tty device?  Ah, we don't even use it for
anything anymore, maybe that should be fixed...

Anyway, just submit the urbs, why use usb_serial_generic_* at all for
the status urb?  That's not normal.

And are you trying to only have one set of urbs out for any port being
opened (i.e. you only have one control, one read, and one write urb for
the whole device, and the port info are multiplexed over these urbs?  Or
do you have one endpoint per port?)

If you are sharing endpoints, try looking at one of the other usb-serial
drivers that do this today, like io_edgeport.c, that has had shared
endpoints for 25 years, it's not a new thing :)

Nor should it, these are independent per-port.

that's crazy, why the timeout logic in there?  This is a write function,
submit the data to the device and get out of the way, that's all that
should be needed here.

Try keeping it simple first, the vendor driver looks like it was written
by someone who was paid per line of code :)

good luck!
