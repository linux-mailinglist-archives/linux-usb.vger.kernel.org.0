I don't think the userspace should have to interpret any of these
VDOs. If the userspace has to interpret the information, then the
userspace should interpret everything for the sake of consistency (so
the "raw" attribute file).

But I still think that defining separate device types for every
product type would be the best way to handle the identity. We could
then have sysfs attribute files that are specific for each product
type. It does not even matter that some of the product types are going
to be removed. We will have to handle all of them in any case,
including the ones that were removed. This way things would be much
more clear for the userspace.

The only problem IMO with the separate device types for each product
type is that we don't always have access to the Discover Identity
result. It means depending on your system we will claim the
partner device type is "default" (no identity information) or the
actual product type. That is also a bit inconsistent, but is is
acceptable? I would really like to here what Greg thinks about all
this.

Well, I'm starting to think that what if we just prepare patches where
we propose separate device type for every product type? Of course, if
they are OK to you?
