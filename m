My reasons for proposing the NORDY sysfs interface *and* termios flag
are as follows:

 - The change should be minimal, but still support non-standard use of
   the modem control signals.

 - The interface should be compatible with using standard tools (e.g.
   echo and cat).

 - We control all other aspects of this (e.g. HUPCL) using termios and
   should continue to do so.

 - We cannot change the default behaviour so this NORDY flag needs to be
   disabled by default (i.e. hence the negation).

 - You cannot generally rely on the state of these lines before opening
   the port at least once, but for applications where this is possible
   and where even toggling them once is undesirable we *can* provide
   some out-of-band mechanism to change the default state of the NORDY
   flag (but we could also ignore this use case, keeping the status
   quo).

 - This could be an interface to control just the initial state of this
   flag after probe() or it can be used in parallel with the termios
   interface. The latter is what is implemented here.

 - As a bonus, using sysfs for this allows this feature to be used also
   before NORDY support has been added to the c libraries.

 - A sysfs interface also integrates well with udev and allows custom
   hardware that depend on this to be setup up once at boot regardless
   of whether an RS-232 or USB-serial interface is used.

Note that one of the BSDs recently added a termios flag with the same
semantics as the proposed NORDY which seems to suggest that this is
interface is indeed a natural one.

Side note: Also the Windows API has a setting for the state of these
lines *after* open (i.e. similar to a termios flag), and there are
reports of Windows users not expecting the lines to be raised on first
open (and behaviour changing between OS releases). For FTDI devices
there appears to be some driver-specific out-of-band mechanism in the
system properties for setting the default behaviour. Perhaps there's
also some general mechanism, I have no idea, I've never used this API.
But at least it doesn't seem to be as simple as Mychaela suggested
earlier, that Win32 got this right, for example, by never raising the
lines on open (by default).

Just chill, and then re-read what Greg wrote.

No, but we'd still be repurposing a flag which is used for something
entirely different.

This precludes using standard tools like echo/cat and terminal programs.

Yeah, this is the worst option; you cannot even disable this feature
unless you provide an ioctl interface as well.

This would be my choice *if* we go this route.

Option 1 is not generic enough, and essentially only allows for your
very specific use case (and not, for example, to suppress reset on open
when using various embedded boards with terminal programs/echo/cat).

Not true, consider the various Arduino tinkerers, they may not even have
designed the reset circuit themselves.
