Putting it in the toplevel usb node makes sense to me, since that's
usually the driver that knows when it's switching into host mode and
needs to turn on VBUS. The dwc3-qcom driver & bindings currently don't 
do this but there's precedent in a couple of the other dwc3 "glues"--see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/{amlogic\,dwc3,omap-usb}.txt

One exception is if the PMIC is also USB-PD capable and can do power
role swap, in which case the VBUS control needs to be done by the TCPM,
so that'd be a case where having vbus-supply in the connector node might
make more sense.
