I hope all the material here is accurate; it's been a long time since I 
worked on these matters.

Yes, I am.

For Bulk endpoints: When a transmission error occurs, ehci-hcd removes 
the endpoint's queue header from the controller's async list, in 
addition to giving back the failed URB.  When the removal is complete, 
the queue is scanned for other unlinked URBs, and they are given back.  
After that happens, the next URB submission will cause the queue header 
to be put back on the controller's async list.

You're right about the lack of synchronization caused by use of a BH.  
The HCD has no way to know when the class driver has finished processing 
a giveback.  We do need to fix this.

Yes; see above.

Suppose URBs 1, 2, and 3 are queued when URB 1 gets a transmission 
error.  It is given back, and its completion handler unlinks URBs 2 and 
3.  The completion handler for URB 1 then returns, but the queue won't 
restart until the completion handlers for URBs 2 and 3 have returned, 
even if that doesn't occur for some time.  At least, that is the intent.

Yes, and in fact ehci-hcd _does_ retry up to 32 times.

What about automatic unlinking?

Note that some class drivers treat -EPROTO as a fatal error.  That is, 
they don't retry and their completion-resubmission loop breaks down.  
When that happens, the only way forward is to unbind the driver (for 
example, by unplugging the device).  Of course, this isn't a problem if 
the original cause of the -EPROTO error is that the device just _was_ 
unplugged.  All other cases are sufficiently rare that we don't have a 
generally agreed-upon strategy for handling them.

Except for an immediate retry, I suspect the HCD should never restart a 
halted Bulk or Interrupt endpoint on its own initiative.  Not until 
another URB is submitted.

However, this seems impractical if the class driver wants to retain the 
existing URBs already on the endpoint's queue.  (I don't know of any 
drivers that do this, but still...)  Perhaps we should adopt the policy 
that -EPROTO, -EILSEQ, and -ETIME cause all outstanding URBs to fail and 
enforce this policy in usbcore by automatic unlinking so that HC 
drivers don't have to do it.
