So, to create a "generic" arm64 kernel, I need to go enable all of the
ARCH_* variants as well?  I thought we were trying to NOT do the same
mess that arm32 had for this type of thing.

Why do we have ARCH_EXYNOS at all?  x86-64 doesn't have this, why is
arm64 somehow special here?

That's my complaint, it feels wrong that I have to go and enable all
different ARCH_ symbols just to build these drivers.  If people want
'default' configurations, then provide an exynos default config file,
right?

Great, let's change it for everyone, I don't see a need for ARCH_*
symbols except for people who want to make it simpler for their one
board type.  And for that, use a defconfig.

I've complained about this before, from a driver subsystem maintainer
point of view, this is crazy, drivers should be building and working on
everything.  Worst case, it's a cpu-type issue, to build or not build a
driver (i.e. s390, i386), best case it's a feature-type issue to depend
on (i.e. USB, TTY, etc.).  But never a "this one sub-architecture of
this one cpu"-type issue.  That feels crazy to me...

thanks,
