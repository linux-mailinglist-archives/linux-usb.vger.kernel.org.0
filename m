I've added generic support to USB serial for setting the closing_wait
parameter through TIOCSSERIAL (e.g. setserial) so that you can change
the default 30 second timeout also with pl2303:

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/johan/usb-serial.git/commit/?h=usb-next&id=01fd45f676f1b3785b7cdd5d815f9c31ddcd9dd1

With the 4k driver buffer and two bulk-out URBs with 256 bytes of data
each you need to set the timeout to something like 420 seconds at 110
bps to allow those buffers to drain (when not using flow control).

On top of that there's the 256 byte device FIFO, which we not yet know
how to query. At 110 bps that one takes about 23 seconds to drain, but
as I mentioned elsewhere we cap the time-based delay at 2 seconds
currently.

Charles, is there a way to check if the device transmit FIFO has
emptied?

Johan
