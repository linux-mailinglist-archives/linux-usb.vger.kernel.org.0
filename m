If they don't set DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND, the PCI bus type suspend
callback will runtime-resume their devices.

Calling runtime_resume() in a suspend callback (for the "suspend"
phase) is a popular pattern because it was recommended once upon a
time.

Fortunately, in many cases runtime-suspended + system-suspended =3D=3D
runtime-suspended.

Many drivers use pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume() as their
suspend/resume callbacks.

There are also drivers without runtime PM support.

It is not all lost I think.
