Would a better approach be to move the code into the xhci-platform
driver, rather than adding a new artificial platform device as
Matthias's patch does?  That's the way other platform-specific DT
issues have generally been handled in the USB stack.

Can the matching be done purely by port number under the controller's root
hub without regard to the VID/PID?
