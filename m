Maybe 100-200 bytes?

Nothing really, the cost of allocating a sub-page structure
is pretty much independent of its size.
What I really meant is it isn't (say) 32 bytes where adding
another 4 could be a significant increase.

There is a bufferbloat issue for usbnet on XHCI.
It would be better to fill the ring with (probably) 4k buffers
and have something sort out the USB frames from the buffers
and then get the network driver to use (IIRC) build_skb
to generate the skb from the data fragments.

I was only using 100M last time I was testing that and
didn't get performance issues.
Just problems with the USB connections 'bouncing', that
project got canned for other reasons ...

But at higher speeds and high network use it might all
be a problem.

Yes, being able to do short transfers from buffer space in the urb
would save all the issues about having to allocate an extra
buffer to avoid DMA from stack.

Indeed for XHCI there is a bit that allows 8 bytes of data to
replace the pointer in the ring structure itself.
I don't remember the driver every doing that.
