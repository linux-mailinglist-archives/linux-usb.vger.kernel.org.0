Not sure I understand what you're saying here.

My point was simply that the layout of the other structures as expected
by the device doesn't match the layout described in you library API
documentation.

It doesn't appear to have anything to do with member alignment, it
just looks like random unused bits in the structures. Take the
single-port config, for example:

	struct cp210x_single_port_config {
		__le16	gpio_mode;
		u8	__pad0[2];
		__le16	reset_state;
		u8	__pad1[4];
		__le16	suspend_state;
		u8	device_cfg;
	} __packed;

You library API has this as:

	typedef struct _PORT_CONFIG
	{
		uint16_t Mode;
		uint16_t Reset_Latch;
		uint16_t Suspend_Latch;
		unsigned char EnhancedFxn;
	} PORT_CONFIG, *PPORT_CONFIG;

which simply doesn't match up (and there's no implicit padding between
members, only after EnhancedFxn).

So my questions again are:

 1) Have you verified that the struct cp210x_quad_port_config above
    actually matches what the device uses?

 2) Do you have any documentation of the structures as expected by the
    device firmware (not your library)?

Great, this could be one way of verifying the above. Please do that and
let me know the result.

That part of the code has already been found broken twice during review
so you really should have tested this before submitting.

Ok, but those do not document the layout of these structures either
(e.g. cp210x_single_port_config with the __pad0 and __pad1 members).
