The driver loading rules are based on level and makefile order. So
renesas will always be loaded before xhci driver. This is required since
xhci claims all devices, so we need to make sure it loads before.

I think we should make it inbuilt driver rather than a module. xhci
driver is only inbuilt.

If there is a better way to handle this, am all for it.

I think this is a valid concern. Let me think about how to solve this..
maybe add a flag in remove which ensure remove doesnt run untill the
probe/firmware callback is completed.

Yeah with userspace not available, that can be tricky!

Yes, we have only bunch of validated versions. There maybe more in the
wild but we dont know. The vendor is not very helpful here :(

Across all folks using this, there seems to be only few versions and
vendor is not supporting it anymore, so chances of new versions seems
remote
