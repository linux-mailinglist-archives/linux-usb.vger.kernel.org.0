Probably it just slipped out of the developer's mind.

Right.

This would be a good place to introduce a macro.  For example:

	} else if (IS_SHORT_READ(token) && 
			EHCI_PTR_IS_SET(qtd->hw_alt_next)) {

or something similar.

The treatment shouldn't be exactly the same as if ACTIVE is clear.  The 
following qTDs can be removed from the list and deallocated immediately, 
since the hardware won't look at them.  And they shouldn't affect the 
URB's status.

Yes.  Awkward but necessary.

Although I know nothing at all about the USB API in Windows, I suspect 
that it manages to avoid this awkwardness entirely by not allowing URBs 
in the middle of the queue to be unlinked.  Or perhaps allowing it only 
for endpoint 0.  I've often wished Linux's API had been written that 
way.

Those shouldn't present any difficulty.  There are inherently easier to 
handle because the QH won't be actively running when they occur.

Yes, I meant ehci-hcd.

All right, then I'll work on it when time permits.

I agree.  But there's no way around it; if you're going to change the 
contents of the qTD queue while the QH is running, at some point you 
have to overwrite something that the controller might be accessing 
concurrently.

THe C standard doesn't say anything like that, but the kernel does 
generally rely on such behavior.  However, it wouldn't hurt to mark this 
special case by using WRITE_ONCE.

Yes, it does.
