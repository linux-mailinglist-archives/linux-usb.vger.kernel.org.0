The issue I believe we're seeing here is not with vfio-pci trying to do
anything with the device, the IOMMU grouping would prevent a user from
opening any device within the group while other devices within the
group are bound to host drivers.  So it should be fine if the EHCI
device takes over the other ports, but it's not ok that ehci-hcd
assumes the driver private data for any other UHCI/OHCI/EHCI device in
the same slot is something that it's free to modify.  It really seems
there should be some sort of companion device registration/opt-in
rather than modifying unvalidated data.

Unbinding all functions first, before binding any to vfio-pci should
indeed work, thanks to the for_each_companion() function at least
testing for null private data before going further.  I'd still argue
though that these hcd drivers are overstepping their authority by
walking the PCI bus and assuming any device in the same slot, matching
a set of class codes, is making use of a driver with a known data
structure that they're allowed to modify.  Even if we claim that the
user needs to know what they're doing when they change driver binding,
that's a pretty subtle interaction with no validation.  Thanks,

Alex
