Well, it very well may just mean that the device didn't have enough
time to get to D0 before reading its PMCSR and it reports a
(internally) cached value.

Yes, that is more conclusive.  [In theory it may still not have enough
time to complete the transition before the read, so you can add a
reasonable delay in there and retest, but I don't really expect that
to make any difference. :-)]

Yes, that'd be the expected behavior in that case.

That would be more accurate in my view.

Sounds reasonable to me.

Thanks!
