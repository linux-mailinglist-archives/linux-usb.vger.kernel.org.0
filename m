I find that  'Halon;'s razor' is helpful in these situations...  I can't think that messing with people who use old teleprinters would be useful in protecting one's products 8-)

If Joe has some wireshark traces we can see if there are any vendor specific USB packets. If not I can try it (I'd be starting from scratch as I've only use wireshark on Linux).

I presume you can't see any differentiators in the normal USB identifiers that we can use. 

If someone has a device that works under the existing driver, it would be helpful to see if the modified scheme also works on those devices?
