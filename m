Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the review. Please see inline.

Sure, I'll point to some existing user space code (which will be using
a similar attribute we are carrying internally).

I did think about it. So I have a mixed feeling about this. Primarily
because I have seen the use of hotpluggable slots in situations where
we wouldn't want to classify the device as removable:

- Using link-state based hotplug as a way to work around unstable PCIe
links. I have seen PCIe devices marked as hot-pluggable only to ensure
that if the PCIe device falls off PCI bus due to some reason (e.g. due
to SI issues or device firmware bugs), the kernel should be able to
detect it if it does come back up (remember quick "Link-Down" /
"Link-Up" events in succession?).

- Internal hot-pluggable PCI devices. In my past life, I was working
on a large system that would have hot-pluggable daughter cards, but
those wouldn't be user removable. Also, it is conceivable to have
hot-pluggable M.2 slots for PCIe devices such as NVMEs etc, but they
may still not be removable by user. I don't think these should be
treated as "removable". I was also looking at USB as an example where
this originally came from, USB does ensure that only devices that are
"user visible" devices are marked as "removable":

54d3f8c63d69 ("usb: Set device removable state based on ACPI USB data")
d35e70d50a06 ("usb: Use hub port data to determine whether a port is removable")

I agree. We can do that if none of the early fixups actually use the
fields set by these functions. I think it should be ok to move
set_pcie_untrusted(), set_pcie_thunderbolt(), but I wonder if any
early fixups already use the pcie_cap or any other fields set by
set_pcie_port_type().

Thanks,
