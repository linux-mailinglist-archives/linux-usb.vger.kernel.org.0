Linux issue on it.

I imagine there are people in AMD that do care, but we don't have the
right contacts here, not sure if you happen to have anyone you could
forward this thread to just in case.

Anyway, I looked again and found some more interesting points and a
likely workaround, if you can help me nail down the details.

I checked again the experiment of runtime-suspending and resuming the
USB controller. As before, the problematic step is waking up. In
pci_raw_set_power_state() the pmcsr is first read as value 103, then
written as 0, then it msleeps for 10ms (in pci_dev_d3_sleep()), then
reads back value 3.

What I hadn't spotted before is that even though it failed to change
the power state bits, bit 8 did get successfully unset, indicating
that the device is not completely dead.

I then increased the msleep delay to 20ms and now it resumes fine &
USB devices work.

Unfortunately it's not quite as simple as quirking d3_delay though,
because the problem still happens upon resume from s2idle. In that
case, pci_dev_d3_sleep() is not called at all.

    if (state =3D=3D PCI_D3hot || dev->current_state =3D=3D PCI_D3hot)
        pci_dev_d3_sleep(dev);

In the runtime resume case, dev->current_state =3D=3D PCI_D3hot here (even
though pci_set_power_state had been called to put it into D3cold), so
the msleep happens.
But in the system sleep (s2idle) case, dev->current_state =3D=3D
PCI_D3cold here, so no sleep happens.
That is strangely inconsistent - is it a bug?

I also noticed that there is a 100ms d3cold_delay, but that seems to
happen before pcmsr is accessed at all, and doesn't have take any
effect here. However, I did also notice that there is no d3cold_delay
done during wakeup from s2idle, it only happens on wakeup from runtime
suspend. The code does seem to be written that way (runtime_d3cold
flag) but I wonder if that is correct. From the standpoint of the ACPI
PM specs, is there a difference between runtime suspend and s2idle
suspend? Since there is no firmware-based system suspend happening I
wonder if the d3cold_delay should apply in both cases.

I compared behaviour to another system with Amd Ryzen5 3500U. It's not
quite the same SoC but the XHCI controllers have the same PCI IDs. On
that platform, I was able to reproduce the failure to runtime resume,
but then it succeeds with a d3_delay of 20ms. On system
suspend/resume, this other platform uses S3, and the XHCI controller
is already in D0 upon resume (looks like the firmware turns on the USB
controllers for us, so Linux avoids any difficulties there).

That seems to agree that quirking these XHCI controllers (based on PCI
ID) to have a d3_delay of 20ms seems sane, but first we need to nail
down why that delay is not applied at all during resume from s2idle.
