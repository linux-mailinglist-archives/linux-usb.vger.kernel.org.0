Thanks, my code wasn't miles off of f81534.c but I'm following that
more closely now.

I managed to get it to work now without any unnecessary waiting.
When I switched to just waiting for per-port THRE I accidentally
re-used the same URB (along with its buffer) for all ports. This of
course "corrupts" data, but it's my fault instead of the chip/firmware
causing it.
That's why I was referring to data corruption earlier.
Thanks for your persistence and for making me look at my code again
with a fresh mind.

Do I need to set anything special in termios for this to work?
The datasheet has a special note about DTR/TNOW (on page 8 for the CFG pin)=
:
> Unified configuration: During power-on, if the CFG pin is

On my test board the CFG pin is HIGH. From how I understand you, RTS
should at least change (even if DTR is in TNOW mode).
No matter what I do: both pins are always LOW (right after modprobe,
after opening the console, closing the console again, ...).
I even set up the vendor driver to test this: it's the same situation there=
.

If we need to make the DTR and RTS output something then the only way
I know of right now is to switch them to GPIO mode (I have code for
this but it's another ~300 lines patch on top of this).
So I'd like to not implement .dtr_rts and drop all CRTSCTS related code for=
 now.


Best regards,
Martin
