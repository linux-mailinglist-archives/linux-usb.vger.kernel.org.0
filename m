AFAICS the vendor code don't reset VBUS, and selectively (only) resets the
PD state machine in the fusb302 on startup. The tcpm state machine is embedded
in the fusb302 driver, making this easier to control.

The fusb302 Linux kernel driver, on the other side, resets the entire fusb302
on initialization, not just PD (bit 0 of the reset register). Question is if
that can be changed to just reset PD (bit 1 of the reset register).
Maybe that would already fix the problem. Can you give it a try ?
