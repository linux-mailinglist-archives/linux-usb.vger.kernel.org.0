Yeah, possible, or you can at least include the DT patches here but mark
them as do-not-merge-yet or similar.

I can confirm that marking the regulators as having been left on by the
bootloader so that they are not disabled temporarily during boot indeed
fixes the coldplug issue here.

That however makes me wonder whether something is missing in the driver
so that it still relies on setup having been done by the boot firmware.

Have you tried actually asserting reset during probe to verify that
driver can configure the retimers itself without relying on the boot
firmware?
