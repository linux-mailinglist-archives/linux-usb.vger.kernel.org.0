I didn't realize the part had a public datasheet:
https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/sites/default/files/xslgc55544cr105_09292017.pdf

It is really only concerned with following the BC1.2 spec and not
interfering with the USB protocol part.

Only because we are looking to expose a policy to control the behavior
of this chip at the OS level.

Most systems would put this in as an option in the BIOS but we do
not have setup menus on Chrome OS and we want to have the policy
controlled directly, preferably without resorting to an opaque interface
to a userspace utility.

To that end we have added a number of different EC controls and are
looking to fit them into the appropriate subsystems wherever possible.
As you can see they don't always fit naturally..

This would come in via the _DSD method of passing parameters to
specific ACPI devices.
