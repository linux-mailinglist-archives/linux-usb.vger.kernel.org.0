Indeed it is just defined without anything attached. I am suspecting
it also may be just leftover, won't be the first one...
No, this particular laptop doesn't have a touchscreen in any of the
three screen configurations announced.

It also does not have a fingerprint reader, nor hardware TPM2.0 (yet
SPI11 typically used for it is still TZ protected :). EC seems to be
over i2c5. Asus's touchpad supports some fancy gesture controls, but
there is in fact another 'extra' hidraw device 'hdtl', I assume that's
the one. No sdcard reader.
Only other still unsupported features are audio (i guess unlikely that
they used different smart amp?), camera (ov02c01, pm8010, so also no)
and DP-HDMI bridge PS185HDM, which from what I can guesstimate is i2c.

So I am a bit out of ideas of what it could be...only thing that comes
to my mind is headphone jack smart amp, ifff they did not use qcom amp
one there as well?

Ah I see. Okay, will fix the order, but will leave `qcom,` as is.

Sounds reasonable and looks a bit better, will update.

Just checked, should be the `qcdxkmsucpurwa.mbn` then. Will update it,

Ah okay. Perfect, keeping as is.
