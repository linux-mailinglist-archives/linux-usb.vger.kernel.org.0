In this case it's intentional.

If we prevent xhci_urb_dequeue() from queuing a stop endpoint command due to a flag,
then we must make sure the cancelled URB is given back in the same place we clear
the flag, like we do in the command completion handlers that clear EP_HALTED and
  SET_DEQ_PENDING.

The EP_STALLED flag is cleared after a ClearFeature(ENDPOINT_HALT) control transfer
request is (successfully?) sent to the device.
If we only give back those cancelled URBs after this then we create a situation where
cancelled urb giveback is blocked and depend on the completion of another transfer
on a different endpoint.
I don't want this dependency.

It's possible that this could create some type of deadlock where class driver ends
up waiting for cancelled URBs to be given back before it sends the request to clear
the halt, and  xhci won't give back the cancelld URBs before the
ClearFeature(ENDPOINT_HALT) request completes..

Lets look at the cases where xhci_urb_dequeue() is called between setting and clearing
this new EP_STALLED flag.

The EP_HALTED is set during same spinlock as EP_STALLED, so urbs dequeued during this time
will be added to cancelled list, and given back in xhci_handle_cmd_reset_ep() completion
handler where also EP_HALTED is cleared. If dequeue needs to be moved then SET_DEQ_PENDING
is set, and cancelled urbs will be given back in xhci_handle_cmd_set_deq() completion handler.

At this stage we know endpoint is in stopped state. and will remauin so until EP_STALLED is cleared.
if xhci_urb_dequeue() is called now then a stop endpoint command will ne queued,
it will complete with a context state error due to endpoint already being stopped, but
URB will be given back in one of the completion handlers. mentioned before.

We could improve this codepath a bit by adding:

Probably no harm in ringing the doorbell here. Should not be needed as there
shouldn't be any pending URBs, see usb core message.c comment for usb_clear_halt():

  * This is used to clear halt conditions for bulk and interrupt endpoints,
  * as reported by URB completion status.  Endpoints that are halted are
  * sometimes referred to as being "stalled".  Such endpoints are unable
  * to transmit or receive data until the halt status is cleared.  Any URBs
  * queued for such an endpoint should normally be unlinked by the driver
  * before clearing the halt condition, as described in sections 5.7.5
  * and 5.8.5 of the USB 2.0 spec.

But I don't see any harm in ringing the doorbell here either.

Thanks
Mathias
