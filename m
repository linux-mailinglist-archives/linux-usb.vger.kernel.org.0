Huh. This particular kernel is proving to be quite resilient, as in 
"announce that it's been fixed, as that'll definitely make it break" 
resilient.

I've done at least 5/6 suspend/resume cycles going between no dock, 
USB-C/DP docks and now TB(USB4) docks and it's resumed properly every 
time (and thanks to 	9d573d195 even seems to recognize topology changes 
too).

(My main USB4/TB dock is at home, A Caldigit 4 with a 7680x2160 DP 
monitor on it; this tends to be the problematic dock for suspend/resumes 
and provided calling these suspend/resume issues publically "fixed" 
doesn't invoke Murphy's Law I'll know if I'd had continued success 
tomorrow).
