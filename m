   "And the latter is called with 0 by", I meant to type... :-/
   The arguments I've heard for this ambiguity to continue were that IRQ0 is requested only with
setup_irq() (no longer true) and that these calls are confined to the arch code (still true).

   These drivers call usb_add_hcd() that only calls request_irq() (via usb_hcd_request_irqs())
if IRQ # is non-zero -- otherwise the driver is supposed to handle the interrupt itself (if it
needs one?) --thus calling usb_add_hcd() with IRQ0 results in non-working HCD without IRQs...
   (For libata, ata_host_activate() (called in the end of the driver's probe() methods) checks
if the 'irq' parameter is 0 early and in this case warns about the 'irq_handler' parameter being
non-NULL and calls ata_host_register() without registering the IRQ handler and expects the driver
to set the polling flag, thus if IRQ0 is passed from an (unsuspecting) ATA driver, one gets not
fully functional host driver).)
