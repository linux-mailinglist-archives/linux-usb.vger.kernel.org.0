This seems unnecessary to me - if we've even started probing a driver 
for a broken piece of hardware to the point that we need magic checks to 
bail out again, then something is already fundamentally wrong.

Old boards only sold with the original SoC variant have no reason to 
enable the OHCI (since it never worked originally), thus will never 
execute this check.

New boards designed around the W variant to make use of the OHCI can 
freely enable it either way.

The only relative-edge-case where it might matter is older board designs 
still in production which have shipped with both SoC variants. Enabling 
OHCI can't be *necessary* given that it's still broken on a lot of 
deployed boards, so at best it must be an opportunistic nice-to-have. 
Since we're already having to rely on the bootloader to patch up the 
devicetree for other low-level differences in this case, it should be 
part of that responsibility for it to only enable the OHCI on the 
appropriate SoC variant too. Statically enabling it in the DTS for a 
board where it may well not work is just bad.

As soon as a DTB with a broken piece of hardware enabled gets passed to 
an OS, then the damage is already done. A driver patch in a future 
version of Linux that magically knows better and ignores it isn't going 
to help a user booting an older kernel image, or some other OS entirely.
