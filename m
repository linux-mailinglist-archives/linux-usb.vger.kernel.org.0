Yes, thank you for understanding.

Thank you for considering working on this. If you decide not to do
this in the end, please let me know then I'll add this to my
(way too long) TODO list.

Ah I was already why there were more entries then I expected,
good job.

Great, that means your patch will be a good starting point for
the broken devices list if we do ever decide to flip the
default for Seagate devices back to allowing ATA pass-through by
default.

Ah yes that helps, unfortunately in the mainline kernel we cannot
assume that that is the case.

It is always an option :) I just don't think that this is the right
moment in time to do it. Notice that your email archive digging +
the https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_USB-Devices have
turned op 4 new broken devices for which we did not have quirks
before. I'm simply afraid that that is just the tip of the iceberg.
Causing peoples disks to stop working is not just a bug, it is
a very very bad bug, so yeah I'm quite conservative here, sorry.

So for now I believe that the best thing we can do is to agree
that we disagree on the best way to handle this.

(Now if only I had this magic-wand which could give me the complete
list of all broken models, then things would be different.)

Regards,

Hans
