How often do these values change based on our past experience with these
fields?

I agree with this in general. I don't think this is an explicit decision
to make them part of API. It is a consequence of simply copying the
transfer_flags. I am with you both on not being able to recognize the
impact until as this is rather obscure usage hidden away in the packets.
These defines aren't directly referenced.

Wouldn't this be easier way to handle the change? With this option
the uapi will be well documented.

I looked at the code and looks simple enough. I am okay going this route
if we see issues with the option 1.
