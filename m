The problem I have is that when you talk about "states" here, you have
the Linux device's runtime and/or system state (active vs idle vs
suspended), or you're talking about the state of a clock, a regulator,
etc (on vs off, perhaps "on at X Hz"), or a performance state (such as 11).

But the states you're talking about is "the state of changing from
active to idle" (which in the other model is the edges between states).

But technically, the driver doesn't know what resource state we're in at
probe time. UEFI might have performed initialization already, it might
have turned the controller off, it might have left it in the shallow
state for some reason.

So it seems to me that exposing this as ON/OFF/"shallow-off" to the OS,
and then have the firmware track the state and perform the adequate
transition would be better.

The wake capability is an interesting topic, because this would
generally be considered a policy decision presented to the OS (to user
space inf act), not a decision encoded in the firmware. I'm not sure how
we would expose that decision through this interface.

I'm not concerned about the complexity of the operations abstracted away
by these signals, Linux has no expectations of the complexity of a
typical D3->D0 transition.

My concern remains, that these are explained as "states", but once you
enter any of the states "init", "system_resume", or "runtime_resume" I
expect the hardware to be in some particular configuration (a state).

It is true that we're trying to convey the "state change" (an action) in
the Linux device's power model to the firmware, so I understand why
you're communicating an "action" in each step, but you're doing that by
taking a performance domain to a particular "state".

I.e. you're using the performance state selection as a messaging
mechanism.
