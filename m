Nobody reading this will know what "S3/S4 press test procedure" means.  
You have to explain it, or use a different name that people will 
understand.

This doesn't make sense.  You already mentioned that only the 
UsbOperational state supports sending start-of-frame packets.  So if the 
controller is in a different state then it won't send these packets, 
whether INTR_SF is enabled or not.

What problem are you really trying to solve?

This is definitely wrong.  You must not turn off SF interrupts when 
ed_rm_list is non-NULL.  If you do, the driver will not be able to 
finish unlinking URBs.
