That's right.

It doesn't help in the situation shown above, but it does help in other 
situations.  Consider this timing diagram:

	CPU0				CPU1
	----				----
					usb_gadget_remove_driver runs
					  Disables async callbacks
					  Calls synchronize_irq
					    synchronize_irq returns
					  Calls udc_driver_unbind
	IRQ happens for disconnect
	  Handler sees async_callbacks
	    is disabled
	  Handler returns
					  Calls usb_gadget_udc_stop
					    dwc->gadget_driver is
					      set to NULL

With the async_callbacks check, everything works okay.  But now look at 
what would happen without the async_callbacks mechanism:

	CPU0				CPU1
	----				----
					usb_gadget_remove_driver runs
					  Calls synchronize_irq
					    synchronize_irq returns
					  Calls udc_driver_unbind
	IRQ happens for disconnect
	  Handler unlocks dwc->lock
	  Calls dwc->gadget_driver->disconnect
	    Gadget driver has already been unbound
	      and is not prepared to handle a
	      callback, so it crashes
					  Calls usb_gadget_udc_stop
					    dwc->gadget_driver is
					      set to NULL

Without the async_callbacks mechanism, the gadget driver can get a
callback at the wrong time (after it has been unbound), which might 
cause it to crash.
