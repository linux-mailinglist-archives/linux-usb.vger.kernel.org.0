Maybe. IIUC currently USB drivers don't support/use suspend_late. Could that
be added? It would simplify matters, otherwise all hubs need to know their
peers and check in suspend if they are the last hub standing, only then the
power can be switched off. It would be simpler if a single instance (e.g. the
hub with the DT entries) is in control.

Yes, some criteria like this.

That might also help the hub driver to determine its peers without needing the
'companion-hubs' property.
