Sure, I'd hope that the other users of DWC3 will also see some pretty
big improvements on the TX path with this.

Well, at least for the TX FIFO resizing logic, we'd only be needing to
focus on the DWC3 implementation.

You bring up another good topic that I'll eventually needing to be
taking a look at, which is a nice way we can handle vendor specific
endpoints and how they can co-exist with other "normal" endpoints.  We
have a few special HW eps as well, which we try to maintain separately
in our DWC3 vendor driver, but it isn't the most convenient, or most
pretty method :).

The results that I included in the cover page was tested with the pure
upstream kernel on our device.  Below was using the ConfigFS gadget w/ a
mass storage only composition.

Test Parameters:
 - Platform: Qualcomm SM8150
 - bMaxBurst = 6
 - USB req size = 256kB
 - Num of USB reqs = 16
 - USB Speed = Super-Speed
 - Function Driver: Mass Storage (w/ ramdisk)
 - Test Application: CrystalDiskMark

Results:

TXFIFO Depth = 3 max packets

Test Case | Data Size | AVG tput (in MB/s)
-------------------------------------------
Sequential|1 GB x     |
Read      |9 loops    | 193.60
	  |           | 195.86
          |           | 184.77
          |           | 193.60
-------------------------------------------

TXFIFO Depth = 6 max packets

Test Case | Data Size | AVG tput (in MB/s)
-------------------------------------------
Sequential|1 GB x     |
Read      |9 loops    | 287.35

          |           | 293.61
-------------------------------------------

We also have internal numbers which have shown similar improvements as
well.  Those are over networking/tethering interfaces, so testing IPERF
loopback over TCP/UDP.

I wish I had a USB bus trace handy to show you, which would make it very
clear how the USB bus is currently utilized with TXFIFO size 2 vs 6.  So
by increasing the number of USB requests, that will help if there was a
bottleneck at the SW level where the application/function driver
utilizing the DWC3 was submitting data much faster than the HW was
processing them.

So yes, this method of increasing the # of USB reqs will definitely help
with situations such as HSUSB or in SSUSB when EP bursting isn't used.
The TXFIFO resize comes into play for SSUSB, which utilizes endpoint
bursting.

Now with endpoint bursting, if the function notifies the host that
bursting is supported, when the host sends the ACK for the Data Packet,
it should have a NumP value equal to the bMaxBurst reported in the EP
desc.  If we have a TXFIFO size of 2, then normally what I have seen is
that after 2 data packets, the device issues a NRDY.  So then we'd need
to send an ERDY once data is available within the FIFO, and the same
sequence happens until the USB request is complete.  With this constant
NRDY/ERDY handshake going on, you actually see that the bus is under
utilized.  When we increase an EP's FIFO size, then you'll see constant
bursts for a request, until the request is done, or if the host runs out
of RXFIFO. (ie no interruption [on the USB protocol level] during USB
request data transfer)

We're actually using both a deeper USB request queue + TX fifo resizing. :).
