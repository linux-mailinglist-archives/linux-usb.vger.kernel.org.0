Hi Heikki,

I gave this a hard look and figured out the issue. Long story short, the
firmware is clearing the CCI on EC RAM after copying from EC RAM to
system memory. This happens both when notifications are delivered and
when a read operation is explicitly performed via _DSM(read). What the
driver currently does after receiving a notification is performing an
explicit read. However by this time the CCI in EC RAM has been cleared
by the AML and the information is lost.

Details:

1. _DSM(read) of the UCSI device:

Copies all relevant fields of the mailbox data structure from EC RAM
to a SystemMemory OperationRegion. The last field to be copied is the
CCI:

     [...]
     CCI0 = \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.ECRD (RefOf (\_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.CCI0))
     CCI1 = \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.ECRD (RefOf (\_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.CCI1))
     CCI2 = \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.ECRD (RefOf (\_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.CCI2))
     CCI3 = \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.ECRD (RefOf (\_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.CCI3))
     [...]

However, for some reason, this is followed by another two operations,
which zero-out half of the CCI:

     [...]
     \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.ECWT (Zero, RefOf (\_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.CCI0))
     \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.ECWT (Zero, RefOf (\_SB.PCI0.SBRG.EC0.CCI3))

I don't know why this is present. This does not cause the problem,
however, only leads to issues if two explicit reads are performed
consecutively. What does cause problems with the current driver
implementation is:

2. The event handler (_Q79)

The _Q79 event handler on my machine is responsible for the UCSI
notifications. It performs a copy from EC RAM to system memory and
triggers the 0x80 notification on the UCSI device (called UBTC).
The final instructions of this handler are:

     [...]
     ^^^^UBTC.CCI0 = CCI0 /* \_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0_.CCI0 */
     ^^^^UBTC.CCI1 = CCI1 /* \_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0_.CCI1 */
     ^^^^UBTC.CCI2 = CCI2 /* \_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0_.CCI2 */
     ^^^^UBTC.CCI3 = CCI3 /* \_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0_.CCI3 */
     USGC = 0xF1
     CCI0 = Zero // These two lines are the culprit
     CCI3 = Zero
     Local1 = ((Timer - Local0) / 0x2710)
     Notify (UBTC, 0x80) // Status Change
     Release (ECMT)


A side note:
I figured this out by booting up a Windows installation and convincing
the local kernel debugger to dump ACPI trace information to a file. The 
file
contained an outrageous amount of information with inconsistent 
formatting
(missing commas and stuff) for which I wrote an extremely janky parser 
in
Python. This let me examine the exact steps performed by the Windows 
driver.
And the difference I noticed is that the Linux driver was issuing a 
_DSM(read)
after every notification, reading the already-zeroed-out CCI.

Patching the AML to remove the zeroing-out instructions seemed to work 
as
well, but I suppose this is not a good general solution.

Following is a prototype-grade patch, in essence performing soft-reads 
most of
the time (i.e. just reading from the OpRegion and not calling _DSM) and 
explicit
reads when necessary. I am unfortunately not familiar with the spec and 
the
hardware in the wild and I understand that it is possible that some 
devices on
the other hand do not synchronize the mailbox when notifying and it 
needs to be
done explicitly. I suppose we'd need a parameter to configure this 
behaviour in
that case with a quirk system. The patch works on my system. Some other 
issues
surface later, but I think they are related to a particular cheap dongle 
I have
because they don't seem to occur without it.

What do you think about this situation? Is the patch reasonable, or does 
it need
a significant re-think?

thanks,
     Sam
