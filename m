heh, not to say "I told you so", but...

That being said, your test is not very good. The whole idea for resizing
the FIFOs is that in some applications we only use e.g. 2 endpoints and
there is considerable FIFO space left unused.

The goal is to use that unused FIFO space to squeeze more throughput out
of the pipe, since it amortizes SW latency.

This patch is essentially the same as reverting the original commit :-)
