AFAICS, only 2 syzbot bugs were fixed in the USB pull request for 5.4, and they
were already closed by syzbot before I sent this reminder, as it seems to close
bugs within a matter of hours.  So probably almost all of these bugs are still
valid.  I'd be glad to resend a refreshed list in a week or two, but if you're
expecting the number of open bugs (or even "active" bugs) to go down much by
itself, you may be disappointed :-(
