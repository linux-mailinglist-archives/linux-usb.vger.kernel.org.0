Thanks for testing.  What is the current composition the device is
exposing to the host?

Can we get a ftrace log w/ the DWC3 events enabled, as well as the
kernel log? (if not at boot up then maybe a plug in/out)  This will at
least help us identify when the DWC3 ep enable is being called (which
triggers the resize routine)

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
