Yes, the best way to solve this is in the uvc driver.

This is actually only partially true. Even with the zero-length packages
it is possible that we run into underruns. This is why we implemented
this patch. This has happened because another interrupt thread with the
same prio on the same CPU as this interrupt thread was keeping the CPU
busy. As the dwc3 interrupt thread get to its call, the time was already
over and the hw was already drained, although the started list was not
yet empty, which was causing the next queued requests to be queued to
late. (zero length or not)

Yes, this needed to be solved on the upper level first, by moving the
long running work of the other interrupt thread to another thread or
even into the userspace.

However I thought it would be great if we could somehow find out in
the dwc3 core and make the pump mechanism more robust against such
late enqueues.

This all started with that series.

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240307-dwc3-gadget-complete-irq-v1-0-4fe9ac0b=
a2b7@pengutronix.de/

And patch 2 of this series did work well so far. The next move was this
patch.

Since the last week debugging we found out that it got other issues.
It is not allways save to read the HWO bit, from the driver.

Turns out that after an new TRB was prepared with the HWO bit set
it is not save to read immideatly back from that value as the hw
will be doing some operations on that exactly new prepared TRB.

We ran into this problem when applying this patch. The trb buffer list
was actually filled but we hit a false positive where the latest HWO bit
was 0 (probably due to the hw action in the background) and therefor
went into end transfer.
