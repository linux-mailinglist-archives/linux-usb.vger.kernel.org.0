Hmm, true, I don't see a "sending frame failed" error message during
the firmware download though. You are right that this codepath is
loosing the error, but this does not seem to be the scenario we are
running into while loading the firmware. This error only happens later
on from the btintel_reset_to_bootloader function.

What seems to happen in the posted log is that the URB is initially
submitted just fine and the transfer errors out afterwards.
Unfortunately, the btusb_tx_complete is only used for statistics
(stat.err_tx is increased) and has no further error handling that could
abort the firmware upload.
