that's not a safe assumption, though. What happens in cases where
Configuration 1 is wildly different from Configuration 2? Say Config 1
is a mass storage device and Config 2 is a collection of several CDC
interfaces?

it might be a better idea to introduce such a flag and make the
intention clear. But in any case, I still think the assumption you're
making is not very good.

Right, that's fine :-)
