The problem with this is there may be multiple USB controllers on a
system (not all exposed outside the case - and also the dummy
controller is often present). How can we configure the system to know
which controller is which?

The only name we have for distinguishing the controllers is the DTS
node. So it seems inherent that changes to that name will break the
config.

That said, this issue reminded me of the /dev/hda -> /dev/sda device
name or the eth0 -> enp3s0 switch which both also had the potential to
break configurations or scripts.  I get that having a standard naming
scheme is important (I'm very sympathetic to this point)! I can
imagine UI trying to show possible controllers for a user to select
needs a simple way to determine if a device is a usb controller - but
again this just shows that the node names are an ABI.

So I'm not the one to judge if this change is useful enough to push
through the pain, but it did seem to be done a bit casually.

DTS changes are a constant source of regressions in my experience. We
mostly just have to roll with it, but it feels never ending. :)  I'd
personally rather folks in general be more thoughtful about what DTS
changes they make and accept, understanding that they do have impact
on userland.  And I'd imagine If updates to linux-firmware broke the
most recent LTS kernel, that would be seen as a regression too, and
folks wouldn't be told to just keep the old firmware.  But all the
same, I'd also be happy for suggestions to remove any such
dependencies userland has on specific dts naming, where possible, to
make the constant pain go away. :)
