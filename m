No, I think the async_callbacks approach is slightly better.

We don't actually need a lock or mutex to fix this problem.  We just 
need to make the remove_driver sequence issue two calls to the UDC 
driver rather than just one: async_callbacks and udc_stop.

Either one would be okay.  If async_callbacks is enabled then 
dwc->gadget_driver should never be NULL, but it won't hurt to check.  
After all, disconnect does not occur often and it doesn't need to run 
extremely quickly.
