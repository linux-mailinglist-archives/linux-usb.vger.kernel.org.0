Yes, and it shows that there really is a bug in the UVC driver.  In 
kernel programming, fairly unlikely == not impossible == bound to happen 
eventually!

I don't know enough about the driver to make any detailed 
recommendations.  But you might consider, for example, that if the 
unbind routine can get along with forcibly removing the V4L2 node and 
not waiting for the release callback to finish, then why not have it 
behave that way all the time?  In other words, shorten the timeouts from 
500 ms and 1000 ms to 0 ms.

Whether you do that or not, someone definitely should fix up the release 
routine so that it won't get into trouble if it is called after (or 
concurrently with) all of the cleanup operations -- which is quite 
likely to happen if those timeouts are eliminated!  In particular, it 
shouldn't call gadget_deactivate unless it knows that an unbind hasn't 
happened yet.  And if that is the case, it should block the unbind 
routine until gadget_deactivate returns.  Basically, it's a bug for a 
function driver to call any gadget core routine after its unbind 
callback has returned.
