   And you're telling me that after I've wasted  time on v2? :-( Well, at least the series had
couple blunders, so it couldn't merged for 5.16-rc1 anyway (not sure why these weren't detected
in v1).

   Well, technically not, although that doesn't match the kernel-doc for the function now.
I only don't understand why returning IRQ0 hasn't been replaced still...

   As I have already told you, I won't have to do it as filtering out is only needed iff 0 is
used as an indication for something special. IRQ0 is still perfectly valid for request_irq()
and is even called by arch/{aplha|mips|x86}...
