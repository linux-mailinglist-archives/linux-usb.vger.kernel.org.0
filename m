Hi,

I'm very sorry.

As Torvalds has merged 93431e0607e5 and many of you devs (including big 
maintainers like David Miller) just applied this stuff, I assumed that's OK.

And now I've rolled out tens of patches via shell loop... *sigh*

As this is the third (I think) change request like this, I assume this 
rule applies to all subsystems â€“ right?

Best,
AK
