Or just disabling runtime PM, I presume.

There is the "return;" which reads that if the quirk is not set, return
from this function early.

Okay, thanks for the very detailed report.

We need bit more information to investigate this. The commit you
referred is exactly for this purpose and I'm surprised it did not work
but also the Barlow Ridge PCI IDs are suprised too, as if this would
have some old firmware or something.

Can you share full dmesg with the repro and "thunderbolt.dyndbg=+p" in
the kernel command line?
