How about initiating async firmware loading before probe is called by using
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_*() hooks?

Probe would then just check if there is a valid running firmware, if not just
defer probe until later (return -EPROBE_DEFER).

No need for a separate Renesas xhci driver, no worries about which driver
claims the device first, no races because of probe returning successfully
too early.

Can we check the device for a valid running firmware without disrupting a
ongoing firmware write?
