Hi Felipe,

I somehow missed both your original email and this gentle reminder.

I believe a lot of these are already available.

Also note, that Divya made it possible to have your own tracing
instance for a module.

Let me know what changes are needed and we can work something out.

Sorry for the delay, it appears I missed quite a bit of emails in this period :-/
