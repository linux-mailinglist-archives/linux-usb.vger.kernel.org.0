The spec lists an example mode entry flow with cable warnings (USB
Type-C Spec 2.3, Section E.5) but it's not dictating the order there.
bleung@ and jthies@ contributed this to the spec and this somewhat
matches what ChromeOS does.

The main reason for having a priorities list in sysfs (vs statically
defined) is to reflect our security policy around PCI tunnels: we do
not allow PCI tunnels unless the user is logged in and has toggled the
flag to enable PCI tunnels (which is controllable via the UI or
Enterprise policy). What this results in is a preference to enter DPAM
when in the login screen even if the attached device supports
Thunderbolt and then a mode switch to Thunderbolt after login. This
was done on older ChromeOS platforms by bypassing sysfs and talking
directly to the EC. With our adoption of PDC and UCSI, we want a
common way to do this without having mode sequencing occuring in
userspace.

The eventual operational goal being:
* A PDC based system will automatically enter an alt-mode in the PDC
by default but allow override later based on the defined mode
priority.
* Our older TCPM based systems that do AP driven mode entry will use
the in-kernel mode selection implementation to automatically enter
modes.
* In-kernel TCPM system will also automatically enter an alt-mode
using the in-kernel mode selection implementation.
* Userspace can change the mode priorities when a user logs in and
triggers mode selection. A new connection while logged in would have
the kernel apply the preferred mode.
* Userspace can change mode priorities when the user locks the screen
but does not trigger mode selection. Only new connections would get
the changed priority and existing connections are left alone.

Our preferred alt-mode ordering:
* Default =3D> USB4, DPAM, TBT3
* Logged-in, Tunneling allowed =3D> USB4, TBT3, DPAM

Limiting to just priority in this file sounds good and simplifies this
change. It does seem to duplicate checks already existing in
`altmode->activate`.

`mode_priorities` and `mode_selection` sounds good.

Making this sysfs only visible on drivers that support in-kernel mode
selection is probably a good idea to reduce confusion.
typec_attr_is_visible should be updated for the `mode_priorities`
attribute to reflect that.

Patch 1 in this series makes the `active` sysfs field reflect the
`read_only` nature of the altmode as well, which should help make the
API clearer for PD controller based systems.

That's fair. With respect to the `predefined list of modes`, these are
all the spec defined alternate-modes (and USB4).

I understand your reservations about the predefined list though. I
think I'd want to see this file have a superset of all kernel
supported modes and have port drivers enable support accordingly.
Right now, the nvidia driver is the only one un-accounted for but that
looks like it's just remapping DP to another SVID. Converting the
TYPEC_SVID_TO_ALTMODE macro to an inline function with a switch
statement would cover that.
