Hi Felipe,

Instead of catching the out of FIFO memory issue during the ep enable
stage, I was thinking if we could do it somewhere during the bind.  Then
this would allow for at least failing the bind instead of having an
enumerated device which doesn't work. (will happen if we bail out during
ep enable phase)  The idea I had was the following:

Introduce a new USB gadget function pointer, say
usb_gadget_check_config(struct usb_gadget *gadget, unsigned long ep_map)

The purpose for the ep_map is to carry information about the endpoints
the configuration requires, since each function driver will define the
endpoint descriptor(s) it will advertise to the host.  We have access to
these ep desc after the bind() routine is executed for the function
driver, so we can update this map after every bind.  The configfs driver
will call the check config API every time a configuration is added.

static int configfs_composite_bind(struct usb_gadget *gadget,
		struct usb_gadget_driver *gdriver)
{
...
  /* Go through all configs, attach all functions */
  list_for_each_entry(c, &gi->cdev.configs, list) {
  ...
    list_for_each_entry_safe(f, tmp, &cfg->func_list, list) {
    ...
      	if (f->ss_descriptors) {
	  struct usb_descriptor_header **descriptors;
	  descriptors = f->ss_descriptors;
	  for (; *descriptors; ++descriptors) {
	    struct usb_endpoint_descriptor *ep;
	    int addr;
		
	    if ((*descriptors)->bDescriptorType != USB_DT_ENDPOINT)
		continue;
		
	    ep = (struct usb_endpoint_descriptor *)*descriptors;
	    addr = ((ep->bEndpointAddress & 0x80) >> 3)
	    |  (ep->bEndpointAddress & 0x0f);
	    set_bit(addr, &ep_map);
	  }
	}
    usb_gadget_check_config(cdev->gadget, ep_map);

What it'll allow us to do is to decode the ep_map in the dwc3/udc driver
to determine if we have enough fifo space. Also, if we wanted to utilize
this ep map for the actual resizing stage, we could eliminate the issue
of not knowing how many EPs will be enabled, and allocating potentially
unused fifos due to unused eps.


Thanks
Wesley
