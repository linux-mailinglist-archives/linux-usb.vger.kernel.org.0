That's not completely true, though, is it?  As I understand it, a USB
3 port is defined as containing both a USB 2 controller and a USB 3
controller.  While it's one port, it's still conceptually two
(separable) things.  The fact that they are on the same physical chip
doesn't mean that they are one thing any more than a SoC (one chip)
needs to be represented by one thing in the device tree.  Though, of
course, I'm not the expert here, the argument that this IC is a USB 2
hub, a USB 3 hub, and some control logic doesn't seem totally
insane...

Interesting question, that one.  When trying to optimize board designs
we have certainly talked about separating out the USB 2 and USB 3 [1].
For instance, we could take the USB 3 lines from the root hub and send
them off to a high speed camera and then take the USB 2 lines and
route them to a hub which then went to some low speed devices.  We
chickened out and didn't do this, but we believed that it would work.

Yup.  It's really two hubs.

localhost ~ # lsusb -t
/:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci-hcd/1p, 5000M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/4p, 5000M
/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci-hcd/1p, 480M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/4p, 480M

localhost ~ # lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.

Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

I think this means that we're already forced to split this one device
across two nodes in the device tree, right?  Oh, or I guess you said
we could change the binding to allow more than one port in one reg?
What would that look like?  You'd have more than one VID/PID listed in
the compatible string and more than one "reg"?

I'd believe that the above could be made to work with enough software
change in the USB stack.  Presumably we wouldn't want to actually do a
full probe of the device until USB actually enumerated it, but I guess
you could add some type of optional "pre-probe" step where a driver is
called?  So you'd call a pre-probe on whatever driver implements
"usbbda,5411" and it would turn on the power supply.  ...then, if the
device is actually there, the normal probe would be called?  I guess
that'd work...

One thing that strikes me as a possible problem, though, is that I
totally envision HW guys coming back and saying: "oh, we want to
second source that USB hub and randomly stuff a different hub on some
boards".  In theory that's a reasonable suggestion, right?  USB is a
probable bus.  We turn on power to the USB hub (and the regulator to
turn on power is the same no matter which hub is stuffed) and then we
can just check which device got enumerated.  It's likely that both
hubs would behave the same from a software point of view, but they
would have different VID/PID.

As far as I understand the current USB bindings account for the fact
that the device(s) specified in the device tree might or might not be
there.  Adding a node under the controller like you show above means:
"if something is plugged into port 1 of this USB hub and if that thing
matches 0x0bda/0x5411 then here are the extra properties (vdd-supply)
for it".  With your proposal I believe we're changing it to mean
"there will definitely be a device plugged into port 1 of this USB hub
and it will match 0x0bda/0x5411."  Unless I'm mistaken, that will have
potential impacts on the ability to second source things.  I guess
both pre-probe functions could be called and (since there can be
multiple users of a regulator) it'd be OK, but if we get into reset
lines it's not much fun.  However, describing the device more like
Matthias has done it will be nicely compatible with second sourcing.
