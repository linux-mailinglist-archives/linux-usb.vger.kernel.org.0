This code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void main()
{
	volatile uint32_t endian = 0x01234567;
	uint32_t v = 0xaabbccdd;
	uint32_t *pix32 = &v;
	uint8_t r, g, b, *p;

	r = *pix32 >> 16;
	g = *pix32 >> 8;
	b = *pix32++;

	printf("xrgb8888=%08x\n", v);

	printf("32-bit access:\n");
	printf("r=%02x\n", r);
	printf("g=%02x\n", g);
	printf("b=%02x\n", b);

	printf("Byte access on %s:\n", (*((uint8_t*)(&endian))) == 0x67 ? "LE"
: "BE");
	p = (uint8_t *)&v;
	printf("r=%02x\n", p[1]);
	printf("g=%02x\n", p[2]);
	printf("b=%02x\n", p[3]);
}

prints:

xrgb8888=aabbccdd
32-bit access:
r=bb
g=cc
b=dd
Byte access on LE:
r=cc
g=bb
b=aa

That it's a 32-bit value. From include/uapi/drm/drm_fourcc.h:

/* 32 bpp RGB */
#define DRM_FORMAT_XRGB8888	fourcc_code('X', 'R', '2', '4') /* [31:0]
x:R:G:B 8:8:8:8 little endian */

If a raw buffer was passed from a BE to an LE machine, there would be
problems because of how the value is stored, but here it's the same
endianness in userspace and kernel space.

There is code in gud_prep_flush() that handles a BE host with a
multibyte format:

	} else if (gud_is_big_endian() && format->cpp[0] > 1) {
		drm_fb_swab(buf, vaddr, fb, rect, !import_attach);

In this case we can't just pass on the raw buffer to the device since
the protocol is LE, and thus have to swap the bytes to match up how
they're stored in memory on the device.

I'm not loosing any of the colors when running modetest. This is the
test image that modetest uses and it comes through just like that:
