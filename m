Agree. Yes, we need to find actual issue.

Hi Thinh,

I ran the code you recommended on our testing environment and was able 
to reproduce the issue one time.

When evt->flags contains DWC3_EVENT_PENDING, I've included the following 
debugging information: I added this debug message at the start of 
dwc3_event_buffers_cleanup and dwc3_event_buffers_setup functions in 
during suspend and resume.

The results were quite interesting . I'm curious to understand how 
evt->flags is set to DWC3_EVENT_PENDING, and along with DWC3_GEVNTSIZ is 
equal to 0x1000 during the suspend.
Its means that the previous bottom-half handler prior to suspend might 
still be executing in the middle of the process.

Could you please give your suggestions here? And let me know if anything 
want to test or additional details are required.
