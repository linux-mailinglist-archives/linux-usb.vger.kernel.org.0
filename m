I'm picking up this series by Guenter Roeck as he stated he has no time
for it ATM. It was found to solve some unaligned DMA access issues on
Raspberry Pi 3. You can find the original discussion here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/20200226210414.28133-1-linux@roeck-us.net/

I removed the fist patch from the original series as it turned out to be
contententious and needs more in-depth testing. Following is the edited
origin series description. Note that extra testing was performed on
RPi3:

"This series addresses the following problems:

- Fix receive transfers with 0 byte transfer length
- Abort transactions after unknown receive errors
  if the receive buffer is full
- Reduce "trimming xfer length" logging noise

The problems fixed with this series were observed when connecting
a DM9600 Ethernet adapter to Veyron Chromebooks such as the ASUS
Chromebook C201PA. The series was tested extensively with this and
other adapters.

The observed problems are also reported when tethering various
phones, so test coverage with such phones would be very appreciated."
