I don't think we should use sysfs to expose and control any of these
objects. It does not really matter under which subsystem we are
working. Sysfs is just the wrong interface for this kind of data.

I'm now preparing a proof-of-concept patches where I create character
device for every USB PD capable device (port, plug and partner). The
idea is that we could use those char devices to tap into the USB PD
protocol directly. Right now I'm thinking the nodes would look like
this (with the first Type-C port):

        /dev/pd0/port
        /dev/pd0/plug0 - you only get this node with full featured cables
        /dev/pd0/plug1 - ditto
        /dev/pd0/partner - and this is here only if you are connected

So in this case you would use those char devices to send the actual
Get_Source_Cap and Get_Sink_Cap messages to get the PDOs.

The problem is that it's not going to be possible to always support
every type of command. For example with UCSI we are pretty much
limited to the capability control messages. But I still think this is
the right way to do this.

Let me know what you think.

thanks,
