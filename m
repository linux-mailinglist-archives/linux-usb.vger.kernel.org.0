That's not good.  As we already know if a module is in or out of the
tree, you all should be banning all out-of-tree modules if you care
about these things.  That should be very easy to do if you care.

Agreed, that is why the policy for this should be in userspace.

And here I thought the requirement was that no one could rebuild their
kernel as it was provided by someone else.

Again, these requirements seem contradicting, but as no one has actually
pointed me at the real list of them, who knows what they are?
