This isn't just an issue with root hubs, the current implementation is
just completely broken for all hubs. Which begs the question of how you
tested this, if at all.

You can access the interfaces of a USB device through

	udev->actconfig->interface

but in this case it's probably better to just export
usb_device_match_id(), which seems to be what you need.
