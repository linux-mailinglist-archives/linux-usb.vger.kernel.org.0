Correct.

That should be something like D0uninitialized.

That you can't really say.

Anyway, it is not guaranteed to do that.  For example, the power
resource(s) listed by _PR3 for the device may be referenced by
something else too which prevents them from being turned off.

> and/or the _PR0/_PS0 transition does not actually transition the device to D0.

Yes.

Which may be the case if the power resource(s) in _PR3 have not been
turned off really.

[To debug this a bit more, you can enable dynamic debug in
drivers/acpi/device_pm.c.]

OK, but then you don't really flip the power resource(s), so that only
means that _PS0 does not restore D0, but in general it only is valid
to execute _PS0 after _PS3 (if both are present which is the case
here), so this is not conclusive again.

OK, thanks for that!
