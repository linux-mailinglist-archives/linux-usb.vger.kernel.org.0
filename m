I've done some experiments with CP2102 receiving a break.
It seems that chip always receives 0x00 for the start of break (with 
correct parity when even parity set, wrong for odd parity) and later 
(probably after 250 ms) it also sets break flag in GET_COMM_STATUS.
I don't see any indication of the break event in data. I tried to change 
some things in your solution but without success.

I also haven't ever seen Frame error (neither way). I tried several ways 
(different tx/rx baudrate, receive a parity data without parity enabled, 
generating shorter breaks) and I suppose that CP2102 can't indicate framing 
error.

Luckily I haven't found any problem with parity checking.Â  :-)

Neither I understand EVENTMASK in AN571 but I suppose that it is used for 
W32 API WaitCommEvent() because of very similar flag list
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-waitcommevent
maybe somebody else can explain possible usage...

You are right, the fake HW overrun in GET_COMM_STATUS isn't reported always 
but very often.
