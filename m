Thanks for your input as always Thinh.  Does the patch still look ok in
its current state?  Last time I had responded to Felipe that I would try
to entertain adding an explicit flag to keep track of whether an EP had
been resized yet or not.  When trying to implement this as another
DWC3_EP_* bit for dep->flags we'd then need to retain this flag across
ep_disable/enable calls, so it looks a tiny bit cumbersome because
dep->flags isn't neatly 0 anymore :-P.

So ep_disable() would need to look something like this:

 static int __dwc3_gadget_ep_disable(struct dwc3_ep *dep)
 {
 ...
	dep->stream_capable = false;
	dep->type = 0;
-	dep->flags = 0;
+	dep->flags &= DWC3_EP_TXFIFO_RESIZED;

	return 0;
 }

The flag would be initially set in dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() and
also would need to be checked there as well to avoid re-resizing.  It
would then get cleared in dwc3_gadget_clear_tx_fifos().

Is this still preferable to the current patch with just the single
register read?

Felipe, what do you think?  Wesley is already working on improving the
scheme to better handle endpoints that get activated only when switching
AltSettings.  But I'd still like to get my patch in as an incremental
fix though since it does take care of an existing issue with disabling
and re-enabling endpoints within the same Configuration & AltSetting.

Thanks,
Jack
