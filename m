Hi Bjorn,

Can we utilize the of_add_property() call to add the "tx-fifo-resize"
property from the dwc3_qcom_register_core() API?  That way at least the
above concern would be addressed.

I'm not too familiar with the ACPI design, but I do see that the
dwc3-qcom does have an array carrying some DWC3 core properties.  Looks
like we can add the tx-fifo-resize property here too.

static const struct property_entry dwc3_qcom_acpi_properties[] = {
	PROPERTY_ENTRY_STRING("dr_mode", "host"),
	{}
};


Thanks
Wesley Cheng
