Continuing the "one release a year" normal progression for the usbutils
package, I would like to announce the 011 and 012 release of usbutils.

There was 2 releases because we have now changed the way usbutils is
distributed, and it took me a second try to get it "correct".

More details on that below, if you are curious, below the shortlog,
here's the highlights of the latest release over the last 010 release:

 - more USB descriptor extensions added
 - python3 support for lsusb.py so those distros dropping python2
   support can be happy.
 - loads of cleanups of lsusb.py by Mantas Mikulėnas and Kurt Garloff
 - SPDX bill-of-materials support, as defined by the REUSE project, to
   make distro packagers happier
 - libusb requirement settled down, again to make some distros happier
 - usbhid-dump moved into the usbutils main

Here's the "shortlog" for those interested:

------------


Now for the details of how the tarballs are released, if anyone is
interested.

Previously, to do a usbutils release, I would run 'make distcheck' on
the repository and upload the generated tarball, after signing it, to
kernel.org and it would do the correct compression and signatures and
all is good.  But that means a bunch of auto-generated files are added
to the tarball, which are pulled from my system based on any sort of
random choice of autotools that I happened to have installed.

So a tarball would not represent the actual files checked into the git
repo, you would just have to "trust" that the files in the tarball that
were not part of git, were "ok".  And that's fine, it's the way almost
all packages have ever been distributed for the past 30+ years, since
when autotools was created.

But now, kernel.org has the ability to create a signed tarball, based on
a signed git tag.  We have been using this ability for a while now to do
kernel releases (both the stable and Linus's releases.)  This means that
the git repo itself is the "true source" of all of the files, and what
is distributed and signed is the exact same thing that is in the
repository.

So now things can be properly verified.  You can check that the files in
the tarball are identical to the ones in the git repository at that same
point in time.

But what this means is that now to build from the tarball, you have to
run the 'autogen.sh' script, instead of running 'configure'.  This is
normally what a lot of distributions did anyway, as that way they would
"know" what version of autotools was building the package, because all
distros happen to use a different version.

Also, the other bad side affect was that the usbhid-dump repository,
which was a git submodule in usbutils, was not built at all as part of
the usbutils release.  This is the reason that the 011 release that
happened yesterday did not contain usbhid-dump, and why I did the 012
release today to make up for that missing tool.

So, in conclusion, if you are a distro packager, you now have a way to
verify that the tarball matches exactly the git repository at a specific
point in time, and you should feel safer packaging things up as you are
not relying on random scripts that are pulled from my personal machine.

If you are a user of usbutils, none of this matters at all, but thanks
for reading this far.

If there are any questions, about any of this, please let me know.

thanks,

greg k-h
