Sorry for being absent for a lot of this discussion.

I want to take a step back from the details of how we're 
solving the problem to what problems we're trying to solve. 

So, question(s) for Michael, because I don't see an explicit 
answer in this thread (and my sincerest apologies if they've 
been answered already and I missed it):

What exactly is the bug (or bugs) we're trying to solve here?

So far, it looks like there are two main problems being 
discussed:

1. Reducing the bandwidth usage of individual usb_requests
2. Error handling for when transmission over the wire fails.

Is that correct, or are there other issues at play here?

(1) in isolation should be relatively easy to solve: Just
smear the encoded frame across some percentage 
(prefereably < 100%) of the usb_requests in one 
video frame interval.

(2) is more complicated, and your suggestion is to have a 
sentinel request between two video frames that tells the 
host if the transmission of "current" video frame was 
successful or not. (Is that correct?) 

Assuming my understanding of (2) is correct, how should
the host behave if the transmission of the sentinel
request fails after the video frame was sent 
successfully (isoc is best effort so transmission is 
never guaranteed)?


Best,
Avi.
