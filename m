No, I don't think so. After all, FAULT_ALERT should be set again immediately
if FAULT_STATUS was not cleared. I think the speed problem by itself may
trigger a fault, and we see the secondary impact of that. Is FAULT_STATUS
bit 0 (I2C Interface Error Interrupt) set, by any chance ?

Plus, you don't see a fault in the first place with the lower speed, or
did I miss something ?

Seems like we all have the same problem ...
