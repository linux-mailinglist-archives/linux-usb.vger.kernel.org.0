Since you have quoted my series, I'd like to get clarification on one issue I'm
seeing. When resuming from runtime suspend in host mode, dwc3-qcom driver gets
the wakeup event and it resumes the xhci driver. But the XHCI IRQs are received
after some delay. Due to this, xhci driver doesn't resume the device, instead,
all the drivers (dwc3-qcom, dwc3-core, xhci) went to runtime suspend again.

But once the XHCI IRQs are received, dwc3-qcom gets the wakeup event and this
time, xhci driver resumes the device.

This is the reason why I added the autosuspend delay of 200ms to allow the xhci
driver to wait for IRQs before going to runtime suspend.

Can you clarify why there is a delay in receiving XHCI IRQs?
