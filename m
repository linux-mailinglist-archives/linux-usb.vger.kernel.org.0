Greetings, I am a banker by profession, i am contacting you in regards
to a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account.
I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $11.6million
dollars to your private bank account, the fund belongs to one of our
foreign customer who died along with his supposed next of kin since
July 22, 2003.The money has been here in our bank lying dormant about
19years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.

I seek your permission to have you stand in as the deceased relative
to enable the bank to release the fund in your favor as the
beneficiary and the next of kin to our deceased customer. The banking
laws here does not allow such money to stay more than 20years, because
the money will be recalled to the bank treasury account as unclaimed
fund. That is why contacted you for a business deal where this money
can be shared between us in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you by
indicating your interest, i will send you the full details on how the
business will be executed.

Mr.Richard
