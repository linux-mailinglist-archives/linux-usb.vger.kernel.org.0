... and reading the code in a closer look, my guess was also wrong.
The sync should have happened in snd_usb_endpoint_release(), and this
didn't change for quite some time.  So my previous fix won't be
effective, too, I'm afraid.  (And Hilif's patch won't help, either; if
it's effective, there must have been a timeout error in the original
case.)

That said, I don't think this is a newly introduced regression, and
race the condition could be in a hairy detail.

Mikhail, can you reproduce this bug reliably?
