Yes, but as this is a pci specific workaround the quirk should go to
xhci-pci.c: xhci_pci_shutdown(), which was added in v5.5

Is the rootcause known?
Is the only possible solution to reset the pci function?.
Have you tried, or seen this issue on any other controller than this TUSB73x0?

Hmm, all bits in both USBCMD and USBSTS are 0. This is a bit suspicious.
Normally at least USBCMD Run/Stop bit, and USBSTS HCHalted bit have
opposite values.
