I would agree in principle, but that has been done by subsystems forever and
(at least in some cases) drivers on bus types like platform on i2c (where
subsystem-level PM callbacks are not provided in general unless there is a PM
domain doing that) don't expect the devices to be resumed and they
decide whether or not to do that themselves.

Making the core resume the runtime-suspended devices during system-wide
suspend, would require those drivers to adapt and it is rather hard to
even estimate how many of them there are.

That's a fair statement, but in general it is more desirable to optimize
suspend/resume than to optimize hibernation, so the latter is not a priority.

I'm not ruling out adding one more flag specific to hibernation or similar
in the future.

Yes, it is.  LEAVE_SUSPENDED really does not apply to hibernation at all.

Yes, in fact SMART_SUSPEND need not be set for resume callbacks to be skipped.

LEAVE_SUSPENDED must be set for that to happen (except for hibernation) and it
may be sufficient if the subsystem sets power.may_skip_resume in addition.

OK, fair enough.

I've incorporated this into the changes on the pm-sleep-core branch
mentioned before.

OK, let me rephrase.

Some drivers that don't use SMART_SUSPEND expect the devices to be runtime-active
when their system-wide PM callbacks run, but the other drivers do not have such
expectations, because the subsystems they work with have never resumed devices
during system-wide suspend.

SMART_SUSPEND is not needed for the latter category of drivers, but it is for
the former and I want the behavior when SMART_SUSPEND *is* set to be consistent
across the core and subsystems, while the other case have never been so.

Cheers!
