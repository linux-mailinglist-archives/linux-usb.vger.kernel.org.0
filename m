Commit 04679b3489e048cd ("Staging: USB/IP: add client driver") says

  /*
   * The important thing is that only one context begins cleanup.
   * This is why error handling and cleanup become simple.
   * We do not want to consider race condition as possible.
   */
  static void vhci_shutdown_connection(struct usbip_device *ud)

but why are we allowing multiple contexts to begin startup?
That's where a subtle race window syzbot is reporting happened.
This driver has never thought the possibility that multiple userspace
processes can concurrently begin startup. Then, it is quite natural that
we make startup simple and safe, by enforcing that only one context
begins startup.

Without serialization between startup/cleanup/event_handler(),
"Fix the above problems:" in your changelog cannot become true.
First step should be closing time-of-check to time-of-use bug
via entire serialization as if "nonpreemptible UP kernel".
