These rules are a sort of high-level overview.  They don't (for the
most part) say exactly what will happen, in terms of which callbacks
will be issued and under what circumstances.  I have tried to provide 
such a description inline below.

Don't you mean it cannot happen during or after the "late suspend"  
phase?  (More precisely, it cannot happen after the time when the core
would issue the device's ->suspend_late callback, but it can happen
between that time and the time when the "late suspend" phase began --
for example, from within the dependent device's ->suspend_late
callback.)  After all, __device_suspend_late() calls
__pm_runtime_disable(), following which the device _cannot_ be runtime
resumed.

Putting this in operational terms, it seems to say that if
SMART_SUSPEND is set and the device is runtime-suspended at the times
when the core would normally issue the driver's ->suspend_late or
->suspend_noirq callback, then the core will skip the callback (with a
similar requirement for subsystems).  Correct?

Well, in theory any driver or subsystem can do this whenever it wants
to, regardless of any flag settings.  It's then up to the driver or
subsystem to make sure the callback "does the right thing".

What I'm concerned about now is: What guarantees can the core give to 
the driver and subsystem, so that they will know what is necessary in 
order to "do the right thing"?

What do you mean by "simplified"?

As I see it, the suspend-side callbacks are generally responsible for 
four things:

	1. Quiesce the device (finish ongoing I/O and do not allow any
	   more to start).

	2. Save the current device state.

	3. Install the appropriate wakeup settings.

	4. Put the device into low-power mode.

(Not explicitly listed: Perform a runtime-resume if needed in order to
carry out these four items.)

During a SUSPEND transition, we usually expect all four to happen.  
During a FREEZE transition, we only require 1.  During a POWEROFF
transition we require 1 and 3, and possibly 4 (depending on how the
platform handles poweroff).

Similar requirements apply to the resume-side callbacks.  (But note 
that RESTORE is not the inverse of POWEROFF; it is more like an inverse 
of FREEZE with the added complication that the device's initial state 
is unknown.)

What changes to this analysis would SMART_SUSPEND allow?  None if the 
device is runtime-active.  But if the device is runtime-suspended and 
the wakeup settings don't need to be changed, then presumably none of 
the four items are necessary.

Is this what you mean?

Okay, this agrees with what I wrote above.

All right.  To summarize: If the driver's ->freeze_late callback is
skipped then the driver's ->thaw-early will be skipped, and similarly
for ->freeze_noirq and ->thaw_noirq.  But RESTORE callbacks are never
skipped.  Correct?

However, the most difficult transitions are SUSPEND and RESUME.  Is it
accurate to say that if the driver's ->suspend_late callback is skipped
then the driver's ->resume_early will be skipped, and similarly for
->suspend_noirq and ->resume_noirq?

One question not addressed above (in fact, the original reason for 
getting you involved in this discussion): What about the device's 
power.runtime_status?  Shall we say that that core will call 
pm_runtime_set_active() at some point before issuing the ->complete 
callback unless some combination of flags is set?  And what should that 
combination be?

After all, we expect that most drivers will want their devices to be in 
the runtime-active state at the end of a system sleep or hibernation.  
It makes sense for the core to do the necessary housekeeping.

Does this invalidate anything I wrote above?

In other words, it's okay for the core either to issue or skip those 
callbacks.  Presumably the decision will be made based on some flag 
setting?

I don't have a clear idea of how pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume() gets 
used.  Are we better off ignoring it for the time being?
