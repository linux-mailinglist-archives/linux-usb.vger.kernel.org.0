Sorry for the regression.

After checking, this statement was true at the time I wrote it but
with the game of patches waiting on ML before being applied, both
our changes got merged almost at the same time.

This patch [1] should enter during the next release (part of a bigger
series), it shows how to avoid this harsh situation where we handle two
(very different) PHY types in the same way by describing better the
hardware in the DT (discussed previously with Martin).

Hope that will help?
