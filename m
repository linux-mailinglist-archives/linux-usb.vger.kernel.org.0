You seem to be saying we should optimize the kernel for a pathological 
use-case merely because it used to be fast before the blk-mq conversion. 
That makes no sense to me. I suppose you have information that I don't.

I assume that your employer (and the other corporations involved in this) 
have plenty of regression test results from a variety of flash hardware to 
show that the regression is real and the device is not pathological.

I'm not privy to any of that information so I will shut up and leave you 
guys to it.
