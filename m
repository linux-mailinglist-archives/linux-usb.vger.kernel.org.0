I have some vague memory of discussing (something like) this with Alan
Stern long ago and the conclusion was that the gadget driver should
handle cases such as this. OTOH, we're returning failure during
usb_ep_queue() which tells me there's something with dwc3 (perhaps not
exclusively, but that's yet to be shown).

If I understood the whole thing correctly, we want everything except the
current request (the one that failed START or UPDATE transfer) to go
through giveback(). This really tells me that we're not handling error
case in kick_transfer and/or prepare_trbs() correctly.

I also don't want to pass another argument to kick_transfer because it
should be unnecessary: the current request should *always* be the last
one in the list. Therefore we should rely on something like
list_last_entry() followed by list_for_each_entry_safe_reverse() to
handle this without a special case.

ret =3D dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd();
if (ret < 0) {
	current =3D list_last_entry();

	unmap(current);
        for_each_trb_in(current) {
        	clear_HWO(trb);
        }

	list_for_entry_safe_reverse() {
        	move_cancelled();
        }
}
