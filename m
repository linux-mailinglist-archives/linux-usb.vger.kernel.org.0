Yuu mean it's actually a union of structures containing these fields,
not a union of these fields, right?

When you say "copied field by field", you mean that the si_pid, 
si_uid, and si_sigval values are copied individually?

The problem is that the compat translation layer copies si_pid and 
si_uid from the 64-bit kernel structure to the 32-bit user structure.  
And since the system is big-endian, the 64-bit si_addr value 
has zeros in bytes 0-3.  But those zeros are what userspace ends up 
seeing in its 32-bit version of si_addr.

So the solution is to store the address in the si_sigval part instead.  
Wouldn't it have been easier to have a compat routine somewhere just 
do something like:

	sinfo->si_pid = (u32) sinfo->si_addr;  /* Compensate for USB */

That would work regardless of the endianness, wouldn't it?

I think I understand now.  Thanks.
