It is an issue with this patchset since any binding for USB serdev will
need to take both kind of devices into account. Period.

You should see it in your test setup as well. Unless the bluetooth
driver you use is doing something funky (e.g. not closing the port).

I'm testing with a mock gnss device here.

No, my point was that serdev devices *are* not shared with user space,
you don't need to use that new kopen helper for that.

That helper sets the new TTY_PORT_KOPENED flag which suppresses the
warning on hangups.
