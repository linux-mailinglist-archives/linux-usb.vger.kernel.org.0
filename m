Good.  Meng Li, can you test a patch that replaces the
local_irq_disable() - usb_hcd_irq() - local_irq_enable() lines with a
single call to generic_handle_irq_safe()?

The driver _does_ work under those circumstances -- provided the
hardware is still present and accessible.

That's the problem: The driver doesn't really support PCI-hotplug.
The code that Meng Li wants to change was sort of a half-baked way to
add such support.
