Dear Friend,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know that thi=
s letter may come to you as big surprise. Actually, as my pastor advised me=
 to reject earthly reward and thanks by handing the project to someone I ha=
ve never seen or met for a greater reward in heaven awaits for whoever can =
give such a costly donation. I came across your E-mail from my personal sea=
rch, and I decided to email you directly believing that you will be honest =
to fulfill my final wish before or after my death.

Meanwhile, I am Madam Elizabeth Edwards, 73 years, am from USA, still child=
less. I am suffering from Adenocarcinoma Cancer of the lungs for the past 8=
 years and from all indication my condition is really deteriorating as my d=
octors have confirmed and courageously advised me that I may not live beyon=
d 2 weeks from now for the reason that my tumor has reached a critical stag=
e which has defiled all forms of medical treatment.

Since my days are numbered, I=E2=80=99ve decided willingly to fulfill my lo=
ng-time vow to donate to the underprivileged the sum of Eighteen million fi=
ve hundred thousand dollars ($18.5m) I deposited in a different account ove=
r 8 years now because I have tried to handle this project by myself but I h=
ave seen that my health could not allow me to do so anymore. My promise for=
 the poor includes building of well-equipped charity foundation hospital an=
d a technical school for their survival.

If you will be honest, kind and willing to assist me handle this charity pr=
oject as I=E2=80=99ve mentioned here, I will like you to provide me your pe=
rsonal data like. Contact me through this email address (elisabethe1981@mai=
l.com) and also send me your private email address.

(1) Your full name:
(2) country:
(3) phone number:
(4) Age:

Best Regards!
Mrs. Elizabeth Edwards
