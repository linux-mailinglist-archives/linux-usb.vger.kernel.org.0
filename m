But it's still in the `if (status)` branch so it will not get
usb_set_device_state
to USB_STATE_SUSPENDED, then usb_resume_both will not do the resume
process for it.

My original thought is, we still take this as an abnormal status
because we don't
really know the reason for the timeout. Set reset_resume for the udev
will make the
kernel to reset_resume it. Or  I have to create a new `goto` name in
the `else` branch
to force it back to the successful suspended process. And should I
clean the status to
zero for pm_runtime_put_sync()? What's your suggestion?
