No.  The HID standard (version 1.11 -- I may be out of date) actually 
says this (section 4.4):

	The Interrupt Out pipe is optional. If a device declares an 
	Interrupt Out endpoint then Output reports are transmitted by 
	the host to the device through the Interrupt Out endpoint. If 
	no Interrupt Out endpoint is declared then Output reports are
	transmitted to a device through the Control endpoint, using 
	Set_Report(Output) requests.

In other words, a device does not need to have an interrupt-OUT 
endpoint, but if it does have one then the host must use it.

Can't _transmit_ output reports.  This is understandable, since such 
hosts aren't compliant with the standard.

What configuration, exactly?  Do you mean that they can't work with 
HID interfaces that include an interrupt-OUT endpoint?

These hosts simply give up when they see an HID interface with an 
interrupt-OUT endpoint?  They don't just ignore it and continue on?

Why not always allow f_hid to receive reports over ep0?  The HID 
standard doesn't forbid this.

Missing the SHA value of the commit.
