I think, if we don't do the handoff, then the BIOS/firmware tries to
send the OS fake keyboard/mouse commands, and Linux isn't ready for that
as we didn't allow hotplug PS/2 stuff.  But I could be wrong, it's been
a long time since we did that logic.

Someone could try to change this and see :)

Welcome to UEFI :)
