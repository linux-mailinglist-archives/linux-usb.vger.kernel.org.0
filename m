That isn't the way they see it.  In their approach you can never 
trust any devices at all.  Therefore devices can only be allowed to 
bind to a very small set of "hardened" drivers.  Never mind how they 
decide whether or not a driver is sufficiently "hardened".

Forget about trust for the moment.  Let's say the goal is to prevent 
the kernel from creating any bindings other that those in some small 
"allowed" set.  To fully specify one of the allowed bindings, you 
would have to provide both a device ID and a driver name.  But in 
practice this isn't necessary, since a device with a given ID will 
bind to only one driver in almost all cases, and hence giving just 
the device ID is enough.

So to do what they want, all that's needed is to forbid any bindings 
except where the device ID is "allowed".  Or to put it another way, 
where the device's authorized flag (which can be initialized based on 
the device ID) is set.

(The opposite approach, in which the drivers are "allowed" rather 
than the device IDs, apparently has already been discussed and 
rejected.  I'm not convinced that was a good decision, but...)

Does this seem like a fair description of the situation?
