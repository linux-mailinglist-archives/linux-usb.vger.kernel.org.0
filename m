From btusb.c:  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git/tree/drivers/bluetooth/btusb.c#n4189
/* Realtek devices lose their updated firmware over global
* suspend that means host doesn't send SET_FEATURE
* (DEVICE_REMOTE_WAKEUP)
*/

Runtime suspend always requires remote wakeup to be set and reset
resume isn't used there.

During system suspend, when remote wakeup is not set, RTL8822CE loses
the FW loaded by the driver and any state currently in the controller.
This causes the kernel and the controller state to go out of sync.
One of the issues we observed on the Realtek controller without the
reset resume quirk was that paired or connected devices would just
stop working after resume.

I think the confusion here stems from what is actually being turned
off between our two boards and what we're referring to as firmware :)

In your case, the Realtek controller retains firmware unless the
platform cuts of power to USB (which it does during S3).
In my case, the Realtek controller loses firmware when Remote Wakeup
isn't set, even if the platform doesn't cut power to USB.

In your case, since you don't need to enforce the 'Remote Wakeup' bit,
if you unset the BTUSB_WAKEUP_DISABLE for that VID:PID, you should get
the desirable behavior (which is actually the default behavior; remote
wake will always be asserted instead of only during Runtime Suspend).

@Alex -- What is the common behavior for Realtek controllers? Should
we set BTUSB_WAKEUP_DISABLE only on RTL8822CE or should we unset it
only on RTL8821CE?
