I think this issue came up years ago when people realized they could
"abuse" this through usbfs, but maybe I am mistaken.

The "do we retry or not" is an old discussion, and one I think we just
said, "if it errors out, we will not retry as something is wrong with
the device".  Corrupted packets don't seem to be something that is even
noticable in the "real world".  When lots of noise happens on a system
that might cause this, usually the hub just disconnects the device and
resets it.
