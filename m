It looks like the second patch you submitted was hand-edited and still
quoted.

And looking at the dashboard it seems like no patch was applied for your
second test attempt:

	https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=72af3105289dcb4c055b

I've been bitten by something like this before when erroneously thinking
that a test command could be submitted as a reply to a patch.

Perhaps the report mail could include the patch tested or something so
we don't spend time investigating syzbot interface failures.
