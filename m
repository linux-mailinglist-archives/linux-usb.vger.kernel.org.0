The patch looks good to me.
Reviewed-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>


BTW, now I found that the driver doesn't have the cancel call for
tasklet or work at the unbind.  Practically seen it's no big problem,
but its lack is a bait for syzbot.  We may need to just call
cancel_work_sync() somewhere, probably at f_midi_drop_out_substreams()
or f_midi_disable(), but it can be in another patch.


thanks,

Takashi
