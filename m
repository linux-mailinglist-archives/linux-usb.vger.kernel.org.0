So does the vbus actually go to the phy? I thought it never went there
and the power for the phy was different (and possibly lower in voltage).

>=20

The other way is to implement the code to get the vbus supply out of a
connector. Then any driver can do the work if it knows it needs to and
we don't have to care that the vbus isn't going somewhere. I suppose
that would need an of_regulator_get() sort of API that can get the
regulator out of there? Or to make the connector into a struct device
that can get the regulator out per some generic connector driver and
then pass it through to the USB controller when it asks for it. Maybe
try to prototype that out?
