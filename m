We only describe the provider nodes in DT and not the individual power domains.
For instance GCC is the power domain provider which is in DT, and USB GDSC is one
of the many power domains it supports, similarly RPMHPD is the provider node in
DT and CX is one of the many power domains it supports.
So we would need some non-DT way of hooking up power domains from two different
providers as parent/child.
