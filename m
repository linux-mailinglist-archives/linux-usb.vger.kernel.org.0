It's getting more generic topic, so let me Cc Arnd and Guenter (I think
once I discussed this with Guenter around watchdog).

This is so far component of a SoC, so it cannot be re-used outside of
SoC. Unless it appears in a new SoC (just like recent re-use of Samsung
serial driver for Apple M1). Because of the architecture, you cannot
build universal kernel without ARCH_EXYNOS. You need it. Otherwise the
kernel won't boot on hardware with DWC Exynos.

Since DWC Exynos won't work without ARCH_EXYNOS - the user will not get
any usable binary - I think all, or almost all, SoC specific drivers are
limited per ARCH. This limits the amount of choices for distro people
and other kernel configuring folks, so they won't have to consider
useless options.

Anyway, that's the convention or consensus so far for entire SoC. If we
want to change it - sure, but let's make it for everyone, not for just
this one USB driver.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
