Thanks for the long response, but I think you have to realize that
creating a new api for something that has been "how things work" since
the 1970's should not be taken lightly.  No matter if it was a bug or
not, changing user-visable behavior is not a trivial thing.  What we
come up with here has to stand the test of time of being able to be
supported properly for the next 40+ years.
