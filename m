Trying to review this code is hard, if not impossible because of the
structure.  Again, USB interfaces are slow, a "custom lockless FIFO" is
something for the core kernel to implement, not for a random individual
driver, to ensure it is working properly.

And it seems like an overkill, are you sure those locks are a slowdown?
