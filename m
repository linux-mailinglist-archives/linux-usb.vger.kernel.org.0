It's a pretty normal procedure for many people; most of USB type-C
docks have a USB audio built-in, and people remove the machine from
the dock after suspend.  So that's an operation that is seen everyday
everywhere.

Still I haven't heard this issue, and it implies that it's either
something new or specific to the machine or the environment.  Or we've
been just lucky...
