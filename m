TBH I have not thought about that and in previous post neither Greg or
Mathias gave a feedback that this was not acceptable...

We can think about splitting but apart from firmware load there is not
much extra functionality that we need to add, the controller behaviour
as a standard xhci-pci. So i am not sure if we gain much by splitting.

Well am still waiting for feedback :( I dont have any update on top of
this, I can repost but I dont think that really serves a purpose.

I would really like to hear from Greg if this series is acceptable and
if not what would he like to see changed.

Thanks
