An uncompressed 1920x1080-RGB565 frame is ~4MB. All frames can be
compressed (lz4) even if just a little, so this is decompressed into the
framebuffer of the attached DRM device. AFAIU I would need to be able to
mmap the received bulk buffer if I were to do this from userspace
without killing performance. So it doesn't look like I can use raw
gadget or f_fs.

The gadget runs in interrupt context and I need to call into the DRM
subsystem which can sleep.

I use only one request per update or partial update.
I kmalloc the biggest buffer I can get (default 4MB) and tell the host
about this size. If a frame doesn't fit, the host splits it up into
partial updates. I already support partial updates so this is built in.
Userspace can tell the graphics driver which portion of the framebuffer
it has touched to avoid sending the full frame each time.
Having one continous buffer simplifies decompression.

There's a control request preceding the bulk request which tells the
area the update is for and whether it is compressed or not.
I did some testing to see if I should avoid the control request overhead
for split updates, but it turns out that the bottleneck is the
decompression. The control request is just 400-500us, while the total
time from control request to buffer is decompressed is 50-100ms
(depending on how well the frame compresses).

I have never grasped all the concurrency issues, but wouldn't I need
memory barriers as well?

This is the result of the previously request operation. The host will
request this value to see how it went. I might switch to using a bulk
endpoint for status following a discussion with Alan Stern in the host
driver thread in this patch series. If so I might not need this.

These values contains the operation (in addition to the payload) that
the worker shall perform following the control-OUT requests.

control-IN requests can run in interrupt context so in that case the
payload is queued up immediately.

Hmm yeah. When I wrote this I thought that the bottleneck was the USB
transfers, so I didn't want the host to slow down performance by
requesting this status. Now I know it's the decompression that takes
time, so I could actually do a status check and retry the frame if the
device detects an error.

Yes, long running (one operation can be >100ms) and can sleep.

Sure.
