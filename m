Thanks for doing all of this.  There's a load of syzbot usb open bugs
right now, hopefully the huge majority of them will "auto close" now
that a lot of USB fixes are merged in Linus's tree.

Then we can sift through the rest to see what we have missed and wait
for the next round of fuzzing that will happen, as the codepaths we have
fixed up can now go deeper :)

thanks,
