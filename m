In theory yes. But we have to add some headroom delay into the
calculation. The worst case we have to takle here is to leave the
encoding thread enough time to encode one full frame.

Right.

This is okay, but will not help since we have to wait for the frame to
finish.

Right but because of the zero requests between the frame finish request
we will unnecessary blow up the frame duration. Although there are not
many zero-requests.

I hope the whole Idea got much clearer to you while I was discussing the
topic and the roadmap with Thinh the last days.

Exactly that is the case.

Can you followup to my discussion with Thinh and add your thougts
to the whole idea.
