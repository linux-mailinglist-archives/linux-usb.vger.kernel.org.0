We have functions to detect the IN/OUT of an endpoint, use them.

We also have functions that determine how many endpoints of each type
that a device has, why can you not use them as well?  Are they only
valid for driver structures, not gadget ones?

Where are you running out of memory?  In the gadget kernel?  Or
somewhere else?

That's fine, I am just worried about your crazy "pack all the bits into
a u64 for no good reason" logic here.
