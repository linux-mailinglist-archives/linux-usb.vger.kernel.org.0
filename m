On Layerscape SoC (such as LS1088A, LS1046A, LS1043A) When I add 'dma-coher=
ent'
to USB nodes without this patch, dwc3 will fail on device enumeration as be=
low:

According to the DesignWare Cores SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Controller Databook (v=
2.60a),
it has described Type Bit Assignments for all supported master bus type:
AHB, AXI3, AXI4 and Native. I found the bit definition are different among =
them.
So, for the example you gave above, feel a little bit confused.=20
Did you mean:
    snps,cache-type =3D <DATA_RD  "write allocate">, <DESC_RD "cacheable">,=
 <DATA_WR  "bufferable">, <DESC_WR  "read allocate">

The register I dumped is as below (partial register):
root@ls1046ardb:/sys/kernel/debug/2f00000.usb# cat regdump    =20
GSBUSCFG0 =3D 0x00100080
GSBUSCFG1 =3D 0x00000700
GTXTHRCFG =3D 0x00000000
GRXTHRCFG =3D 0x00000000
GCTL =3D 0x30c11004
GEVTEN =3D 0x00000000
GSTS =3D 0x3e800001
GUCTL1 =3D 0x0000018a
GSNPSID =3D 0x5533280a
GGPIO =3D 0x00000000
GUID =3D 0x00050100
 GUCTL =3D 0x0200c010
GBUSERRADDR0 =3D 0x00000000
GBUSERRADDR1 =3D 0x00000000
GPRTBIMAP0 =3D 0x00000000
GPRTBIMAP1 =3D 0x00000000
...

The value of GSBUSCFG0 is the same to what I dump in bootloader(U-boot)
Which mean that's the default value.

Ran
