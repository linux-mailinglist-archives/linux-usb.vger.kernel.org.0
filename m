For xhci I assumed that the device endpoint is halted when we receive
a  'Stall Error' transfer event for bulk or interrupt transfers.

Other errors such as 'Transaction Error' do halt the host side,
but does not necessarily mean whole endpoint is halted. This is based
on the info in xhci 4.6.8.1 "Soft Retry" :

"xHC shall halt an endpoint with a USB Transaction Error after CErr
retries have been performed. The USB device is not aware that the xHC
has halted the endpoint, and will be waiting for another retry, so a
Soft Retry may be used to perform additional retries and recover from
an error which has caused the xHC to halt an endpoint."

Intention was not to restart the endpoint, but turns out we end up doing it.

Basically we should not ring the doorbell  when 'Set TR Deq' command completes
for a bulk or interrupt endpoint in case the command was queued to resolve a
Stall Error. For control endpoint we should restart the ring (xHC halts
the internal control endpoint on errors/stall)

Using a BH also means class driver may queue a new URB to xhci after xhci has
cleared its internal endpoint halt condition, but before class driver is
aware that endpoint halted.

I don't think your patch makes the existing issue worse in any significant
way.
