The irq type is IRQ_NONE£¬It's counted in the note_interrupt function.
From the analysis of the driver code, that are indeed  interrupt signals.

When the host controller is suspended, the ehci_suspend() will clear
the HCD_FLAG_HW_ACCESSIBLE, and then usb_hcd_irq() will return IRQ_NONE
directly without calling ehci_irq().

BIT(5) and BIT(3) are setted, STS_IAA and STS_FLR.

Because of our USB IP comes from Synopsys, and the uncleared flage is also caused by
special hardware design, in addition, we have not tested other manufacturers' USB
controllers.We don¡¯t know if other manufacturers¡¯ designs have this problem,
so this modification is only limited to this kind of design.
