Guys, thanks a lot for your recommendations. Andy Shevchenko contacted 
me with Hans de Goede and with their great help one of my Atom Z8350 
noname tablets turned out to support the dwc3 device mode on one of its 
USB3-A ports.

Only highspeed, but that's way better now :-)

Thanks to all,

Pavel.
