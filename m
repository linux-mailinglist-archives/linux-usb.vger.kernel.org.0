A very respectable goal :-)

I just want to take the opportunity to turn this into something more
generic so we stop depending on kernel patches to support newer USB
classes.

I'll try to allocate some time during next week (this week, I'm totally
swamped) to carefully review your submission.

Yeah, halting endpoints, cancelling all pending requests, tell userspace
about it, and so on.

Greg doesn't want it, so let's stop that for now.

I would prefer to not see GFP_ATOMIC at all here and I think it's
totally doable, but I could be wrong.
