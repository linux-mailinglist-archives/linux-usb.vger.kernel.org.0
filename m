That's fine, drivers are easy, but when I see comments like "ARCH_
symbols contradict" that means that we can not make a generic kernel
image.  Otherwise there's no contradiction :)

And "new drivers" are almost always not really "new" as everyone uses
much the same IP blocks.  As proof of this patch where the DWC3 IP block
is being used by multiple SoC vendors.  To handle that, you split out
the SoC-specific portions into sub-drivers, so that you can build a
single image of the driver that works on multiple platforms.  Nothing
new, we've been doing this for years, it's just that out-of-mainline SoC
trees that think they can touch "core IP block code" break this all the
time, which is what I am pushing back on.

Anyway, this is just me as a driver subsystem maintainer being grumpy to
see ARCH_ dependancies on tiny little things like SoC-portions for
generic IP drivers.  Or on individual drivers (i.e. Samsung serial port
driver), where they don't belong at all.

So the overall goal of the original patch here is great, I want to see
that happen, as long as it's done in a way that does not ignore feedback
of arch maintainers...

thanks,
