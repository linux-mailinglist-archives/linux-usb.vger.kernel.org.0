This is not enough. Build the Type-C Class as a module and the USB bus
statically, and the links will not get created.

I'm not sure you actually achieve much with this series, and I'm not
sure this approach will ever fully solve the problem. As long as we
have to declare API, we will have the circular dependency issue on our
hands. But there are ways to avoid that.

There is for example the component framework (drivers/base/component.c)
that I've been thinking about using here. In this case it would work
so that you declare the USB Type-C part as your aggregate driver, and
everything that is connected to it (so USB ports, DisplayPorts, TBT,
etc.) would then just declare themselves as general components. Could
you take a look at that?

thanks,
