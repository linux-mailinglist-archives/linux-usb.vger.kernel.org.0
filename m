Hi Ferry,

Thanks!  So does your board support SSUSB by any chance?  Based on the
DSTS output, it seems that its currently operating in HSUSB mode.  I
guess we'd expect higher tput values as well in general if we are in
SSUSB mode.

The resize logic would only happen if the device was in SSUSB, as SSUSB
has endpoint bursting, which is the main incentive for the fifo resize.

Thanks
Wesley Cheng

>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Checking for fs_descriptors instead of
>>>>>>>>>>>> ss_descriptors for
>>>>>>>>>>>> determining the
>>>>>>>>>>>>         endpoint count for a particular configuration.
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Re-ordered patch series to fix patch dependencies.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>> Changes in V5:
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Added check_config() logic, which is used to
>>>>>>>>>>>> communicate the
>>>>>>>>>>>> number of EPs
>>>>>>>>>>>>         used in a particular configuration.  Based on this, the
>>>>>>>>>>>> DWC3
>>>>>>>>>>>> gadget driver
>>>>>>>>>>>>         has the ability to know the maximum number of eps
>>>>>>>>>>>> utilized in
>>>>>>>>>>>> all
>>>>>>>>>>>> configs.
>>>>>>>>>>>>         This helps reduce unnecessary allocation to unused eps,
>>>>>>>>>>>> and will
>>>>>>>>>>>> catch fifo
>>>>>>>>>>>>         allocation issues at bind() time.
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Fixed variable declaration to single line per variable,
>>>>>>>>>>>> and
>>>>>>>>>>>> reverse xmas.
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Created a helper for fifo clearing, which is used by
>>>>>>>>>>>> ep0.c
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>> Changes in V4:
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Removed struct dwc3* as an argument for
>>>>>>>>>>>> dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos()
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Removed WARN_ON(1) in case we run out of fifo space
>>>>>>>>>>>>       Changes in V3:
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Removed "Reviewed-by" tags
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Renamed series back to RFC
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Modified logic to ensure that fifo_size is reset if we
>>>>>>>>>>>> pass the
>>>>>>>>>>>> minimum
>>>>>>>>>>>>         threshold.  Tested with binding multiple FDs
>>>>>>>>>>>> requesting 6
>>>>>>>>>>>> FIFOs.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>> Changes in V2:
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Modified TXFIFO resizing logic to ensure that each
>>>>>>>>>>>> EP is
>>>>>>>>>>>> reserved a
>>>>>>>>>>>>         FIFO.
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Removed dev_dbg() prints and fixed typos from patches
>>>>>>>>>>>>       - Added some more description on the dt-bindings commit
>>>>>>>>>>>> message
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>> Currently, there is no functionality to allow for resizing the
>>>>>>>>>>>> TXFIFOs, and
>>>>>>>>>>>> relying on the HW default setting for the TXFIFO depth.  In
>>>>>>>>>>>> most
>>>>>>>>>>>> cases, the
>>>>>>>>>>>> HW default is probably sufficient, but for USB compositions
>>>>>>>>>>>> that
>>>>>>>>>>>> contain
>>>>>>>>>>>> multiple functions that require EP bursting, the default
>>>>>>>>>>>> settings
>>>>>>>>>>>> might not be enough.  Also to note, the current SW will
>>>>>>>>>>>> assign an
>>>>>>>>>>>> EP to a
>>>>>>>>>>>> function driver w/o checking to see if the TXFIFO size for that
>>>>>>>>>>>> particular
>>>>>>>>>>>> EP is large enough. (this is a problem if there are multiple HW
>>>>>>>>>>>> defined
>>>>>>>>>>>> values for the TXFIFO size)
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>> It is mentioned in the SNPS databook that a minimum of TX FIFO
>>>>>>>>>>>> depth = 3
>>>>>>>>>>>> is required for an EP that supports bursting.  Otherwise, there
>>>>>>>>>>>> may be
>>>>>>>>>>>> frequent occurences of bursts ending.  For high bandwidth
>>>>>>>>>>>> functions,
>>>>>>>>>>>> such as data tethering (protocols that support data
>>>>>>>>>>>> aggregation),
>>>>>>>>>>>> mass
>>>>>>>>>>>> storage, and media transfer protocol (over FFS), the bMaxBurst
>>>>>>>>>>>> value
>>>>>>>>>>>> can be
>>>>>>>>>>>> large, and a bigger TXFIFO depth may prove to be beneficial in
>>>>>>>>>>>> terms
>>>>>>>>>>>> of USB
>>>>>>>>>>>> throughput. (which can be associated to system access latency,
>>>>>>>>>>>> etc...)  It
>>>>>>>>>>>> allows for a more consistent burst of traffic, w/o any
>>>>>>>>>>>> interruptions, as
>>>>>>>>>>>> data is readily available in the FIFO.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>> With testing done using the mass storage function driver, the
>>>>>>>>>>>> results
>>>>>>>>>>>> show
>>>>>>>>>>>> that with a larger TXFIFO depth, the bandwidth increased
>>>>>>>>>>>> significantly.
