It's hard to go wrong with reverting, so it's okay with me.

Still, Hans, have you checked out the difference between the 
scsi_add_host() and scsi_add_host_with_dma() calls?  It's just a matter 
of using dev vs. sysdev.  In particular, have you checked to see what 
those two devices are on your system?

It seems likely that if one of those calls messes up some DMA settings, 
the other one does too -- just maybe not settings that matter much.
