sure, I support that. But I want to make sure the first cut isn't likely
to break things left and right :)

Hence, let's at least get more testing.

right, that's the reason why we introduced the endpoint feature
flags. The end goal was that the UDC would be able to have custom
feature flags paired with ->validate_endpoint() or whatever before
allowing it to be enabled. Then the UDC driver could tell UDC core to
skip that endpoint on that particular platform without interefering with
everything else.

Of course, we still need to figure out a way to abstract the different
dwc3 instantiations.

The problem then, just as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, will be
coming up with a solution that's elegant and works for all different
instantiations of dwc3 (or musb, cdns3, etc).

Fair enough, I agree. Can we get some more testing of $subject, though?
Did you test $subject with upstream too? Which gadget drivers did you
use? How did you test

I wish :)

If Synopsys wants to give me access for the databook, I would not mind :-)

What I noticed with g_mass_storage is that we can amortize the cost of
fetching data from memory, with a deeper request queue. Whenever I
test(ed) g_mass_storage, I was doing so with 250 requests. And that was
enough to give me very good performance. Never had to poke at TX FIFO
resizing. Did you try something like this too?

I feel that allocating more requests is a far simpler and more generic
method that changing FIFO sizes :)

This is good background information. Thanks for bringing this
up. Admitedly, we still have ISOC issues with dwc3. I'm interested in
knowing if a deeper request queue would also help here.

Remember dwc3 can accomodate 255 requests + link for each endpoint. If
our gadget driver uses a low number of requests, we're never really
using the TRB ring in our benefit.
