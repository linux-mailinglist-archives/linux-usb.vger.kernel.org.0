Yes, this would give a clear answer whether or not DMA was needed in
the first place. But I do not own that gs_usb device to do the
benchmark myself (and to be honest I do not have time to dedicate for
this at the moment, maybe I will do it later on some other devices).

Has anyone from the linux-can mailing list ever done such a benchmark?
Else, is there anyone who would like to volunteer?


Yours sincerely,
