Hi Matwey,

Sorry for my late response. This series does improve isoch transfers for
webcam on musb. A few of my cameras used to fail to stream 640x480@30fps
now the test passed with your patches. Thank you for the work.

But since the patch changes the way handling urb giveback, I would need
more time to run more tests.

-Bin.
