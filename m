To recap: The problem is that uvcvideo tries to change an interface 
altsetting (from within uvc_video_start_streaming -> 
uvc_video_start_transfer) after the driver has been unbound from the 
device.  This triggers an invalid memory reference.

I really dislike the idea of papering over a problem instead of fixing 
it properly.

Laurent Pinchart is the person to ask.  He is the maintainer of the 
uvcvideo driver.  I know very little about it.
