The kernel ULPI-bus API isn't clear about that. I also couldn't find an example
of using the ULPI-bus accessors in the atomic context or being implemented with
the sleeping methods. So there is no certain answer to your question. Anyway I
added an ms-sleep in the later patch to fix the suspend-regression problem. I
thought it was reasonable since I couldn't find an example of using the
accessors in the atomic context.

Regarding this patch. I wouldn't suggest to replace the ndelay with sleeping
here, since 5-7 ref clock ticks is enough to finish the transaction for the vast
majority of the cases. It's just 80 - 115 ns, which can't be reached by the
sleeping procedures.

I wouldn't say it's complex. Here I've implemented a simple calculation of the
time needed to finish the ULPI-bus commands in accordance with the number of
ticks they normally require. Regarding the while-looping alas we can't get rid
of it here for the reason I've described in the patch 3 of the series.
