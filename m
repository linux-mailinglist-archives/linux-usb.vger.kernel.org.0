Since all SoCs have the pwr_event (HS) interrupt, but not all
controllers have the SS PHY interrupt, this would prevent expressing
that the SS PHY is optional by keeping it last in the binding schema and
making sure that minItem = maxItems - 1.

And as we discussed, the aim here is to group the three classes of SoCs
(qusb2, qusb2+, femto) and fix the order of these interrupts once and
for all so that random reorderings, renames and omissions do not make it
into the bindings next time someone grabs a downstream DT and sends it
upstream.
