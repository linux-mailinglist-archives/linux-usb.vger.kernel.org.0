The tricky part is that there were AMD and NVIDIA specific proprietary
_PR3-like ACPI methods (plus whatever Apple did) prior to GPU power
control standardizing on _PR3.  Currently those methods are handled in
the drivers directly, sort of tangled up with vga_switcheroo.  I think
ideally that logic would move to the ACPI core and be handled the same
way as _PR3, but I'm not sure how well that would work because of the
various bios date checks around _PR3 and the lack of general _PR3
support in those older platforms.  So I think we still need some sort
of "is this soldered in" check.
