Problem with card selection is that it will most likely work in pretty 
random way during reboots and similar scenarios.

Taking from your example:
	USB Offload Playback Route Card Select  1 (range -1->32)
	USB Offload Playback Route PCM Select   0 (range -1->255)
	USB Offload Playback Route Card Status  -1 (range -1->32)
	USB Offload Playback Route PCM Status   -1 (range -1->255)

This tells that hw:1,0 will be offloaded USB card. What happens if after 
reboot the USB card and offload card change places, the control will be 
pointing at its owner... Another scenario to consider is that user 
attaches two USB cards and only first one does offload. Now what happens 
when they enumerate in different order after reboot (swapping places)? 
Taking into the account that most systems restore previous values of 
controls in some way - this will point at wrong card.

In my opinion Offload capability should be the capability of the 
endpoint - in this case USB card (even if in the background it needs to 
talk to some other device) and it should be exposed as such. Currently 
you are mixing capabilities of your audio card with capabilities of USB 
card.

And adding more controls will not make it easy to use from end user 
perspective. Most users will most likely want for the devices to perform 
offload automatically if possible to save power and just have control to 
disable it in case they want to test if it works better without it in 
case of some problems.

Additional question what happens if you want to offload two usb cards, 
currently the above set of controls allows you to only point at one 
card, will you be adding additional set of above controls dynamically 
for each USB card attached?

Thanks,
Amadeusz
