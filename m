Allowing the lowest level to operate even in S3 is only a small part of the puzzle, someone's got to provide data at some point. Unless the data is generated also by a side DSP having access to mass storage or wireless interfaces?

That would imply a buffering scheme that's significantly larger than usual offloaded solutions. In "typical" offload implementations it's rare to go beyond 100s of ms, since at some point you run into user-experience issues when applying volume changes or when changing tracks. It's usually a no-go if the user has to wait for a perceivable amount of time while the buffers drain.

My recollection of mobile devices is that they only relied on S0 platform substates, e.g. S0i1, S0i2, so that the device was always 'active' from a pm_runtime perspective. I have never seen a case where the device was 'active' in S3, I don't think this can work with the current system/pm_runtime power management, can it?
In other words, audio streaming was supported in S0/D0, S0ix/D0ix but S3/D0ix was not a supported configuration.

That said, if you managed to make this work, at the very least this should be a device-specific property, not an unconditional blanket enablement of a capability that raises quite a few questions.
