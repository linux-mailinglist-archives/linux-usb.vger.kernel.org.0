I definitely was not understanding this correctly.  There is no path
for a D3cold -> D3hot transition.  Per spec (PCIe r5.0, sec 5.8), the
only legal exit from D3cold is to D0uninitialized.

I know you tried a debug patch to call pci_dev_wait(), and it didn't
work, but I'm not sure exactly where it was called.  I have these
patches on my pci/pm branch for v5.5:

  bae26849372b ("PCI/PM: Move pci_dev_wait() definition earlier")
  395f121e6199 ("PCI/PM: Wait for device to become ready after power-on")

The latter adds the wait just before we call
pci_raw_set_power_state().  If the device is responding with CRS
status, that should be the point where we'd see it.  If you have a
chance to try it, I'd be interested in the results.  Here's the
branch:
