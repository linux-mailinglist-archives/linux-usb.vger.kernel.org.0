exactly, but it shouldn't go there anyway. This section of the code is
only for 'in case an error already happened'.
That's why I'm asking if anyone knows a practical situation where this
is really needed - and did it ever help?
I'm working with USB across many systems for nearly 2 decades and I
never saw any of those fallbacks succeeding. Usually the way to recover
a device which had connection issues was to reconnect the device
completely.

Yes this would be the second line of defense as indicated in my email
before.
I'm preparing 2 small patches with comments in the code.
One commenting out usb_ep0_reinit and the other one a simple NULL PTR
check - but
again the code shouldn't be executed at all when bw_table =3D=3D NULL
something already
went wrong, the issue should be handled earlier in the code already.

bw_table is not setting itself to NULL or not at all.

Since it's infrastructure code it's a sensitive part.

This issue fully crashed my Asus notebook at least 3 times when working
with a USB ethernet adapter and a USB harddisk. Not only faulty
hardware is causing that problem also simple hotplug connection
problems.

This is exactly the same problem yes.
The problem will happen with all systems which use the xhci driver.
