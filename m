I think saying that there is no infrastructure for writing Rust drivers is =
not
accurate:

We already have lots of infrastructure in place, such as device / driver co=
re
infrastructure, PCI, platform (with OF and ACPI), faux and auxilirary bus
infrastructure, I/O, workqueues, timekeeping, cpufreq, firmware, DMA and a =
lot
more.

Not to forget the absolute core primitives, such as kernel allocators, xarr=
ay,
locking infrastructure or very recently maple tree and LKMM atomics.

Besides that we also have a lot of infrastructure that we do not have in C
because it's simply not possible or applicable.

However, it is in fact true that there is no USB infrastructure yet.

This is exactly why we develop Nova in-tree, such that we have a justificat=
ion
for adding all this infrastructure.

Lot's of the stuff I listed above originates from that and I think the Nova
project has proven that we can break this chicken and egg problem. I think
one proof for that is that Tyr follows the approach.

However, I agree that it still remains that someone (i.e. some driver) has =
to
take the burden of doing the "heavy lifting" for a particular subsystem.
