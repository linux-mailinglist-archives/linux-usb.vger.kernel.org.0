That depends on what exactly happens when you try to do the D0-D3-D0
with setpci.  If the device becomes unreachable (or worse) after that,
it indicates a platform issue.  It should not do any harm at the
least.

However, in principle D0-D3-D0 at the PCI level alone may not be
sufficient, because ACPI may need to be involved.

I think that PM-runtime should suspend XHCI controllers without
anything on the bus under them, so I wonder what happens if
".../power/control" is set to "on" and then to "auto" for that device,
with the driver loaded.

PCI devices without drivers cannot be runtime-suspended at all.
