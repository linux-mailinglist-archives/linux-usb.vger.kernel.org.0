I have no idea what "BIOS/firmware sending OS fake keyboard/mouse
commands" means.  From the OS point of view, does that look like USB
events that cause PCI interrupts?  PS/2 interrupts?  Are these
commands caused by the user typing or moving the mouse?  Or does BIOS
fabricate commands for other reasons?

The way you describe it, this *sounds* like a race, where Linux
mishandles commands that happen before the handoff quirk.  Do you
remember what happens if BIOS sends a fake command before Linux is
ready for it?  Unexpected interrupt?
