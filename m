To put a USB device into runtime suspend, do this:

	echo 0 >/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../bConfigurationValue
	echo auto >/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/control

where ... is the pathname for the device you want to suspend.  (Note 
that this will unbind the device from its driver, so make sure there's 
no possibility of data loss before you do it.)

To resume the device, write "on" to the power/control file.  You can 
verify the runtime-PM status by reading the files in the power/ 
subdirectory.

Another thing to consider: You shouldn't return 0 from usb_port_suspend 
if the port wasn't actually suspended.  We don't want to kernel to have 
a false idea of the hardware's current state.
