I still don't understand.

Are you saying that your OHCI controller behaves badly because it sends 
SOF packets even when the state is different from UsbOperational?

This problem happens when you go into S3 or S4 suspend, right?  So you 
should fix the problem by disabling INTR_SF when the root hub is 
suspended.  Try adding

	/* All ED unlinks should be finished, no need for SOF interrupts */
	ohci_writel(ohci, OHCI_INTR_SF, &ohci->regs->intrdisable);

into ohci_rh_suspend(), just before the update_done_list() call.  If you 
add this then INTR_SF will not be enabled during S3 or S4 suspend, so 
the problem shouldn't occur.  Does that work for you?

I'm worried that your patch may disable INTR_SF even when the controller 
has not gone into S3 or S4 suspend.  Maybe this won't cause problems, 
but it's better to be safe and do the disable _only_ when a suspend 
occurs.
