See

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-usb/patch/20200226210414.28133-2-linux@roeck-us.net/

for details. It isn't up to date - it says that buffer alignment to
DWC2_USB_DMA_ALIGN would be acceptable. However, it turned out in testing
that buffers do have to be aligned to dma_get_cache_alignment(), at least
on some mips systems.

My latest work-in-progress patch describes the changes made as:

    To simplify the code, move the old data pointer back to the beginning of
    the new buffer, restoring most of the original commit. Increase buffer
    alignment to dma_get_cache_alignment(). Ensure that the data pointer is
    DMA aligned by using ____cacheline_aligned instead of realigning it after
    allocation. Ensure that the allocated buffer is a multiple of
    wMaxPacketSize to guarantee that the chip does not write beyond the end
    of the buffer.

I can provide that version of the patch in case someone wants to pick it up,
but it would need thorough testing on a variety of systems before it is
applied.
