Currently usb-connector node has no "vbus-supply" property and
I do not find process that handles vbus-supply in RT1711H TypeC driver.

The otg-switch-gpios controls a mux like fsusb30mux. It is related to
the board design of HiKey960. And the state of the mux is decided by
the typeC port state. So I think it is not so good to make it belongs
in USB controller node.

There is no particular code except the power control for the hub.
The i2c on the hub is not used. So it can not be an I2C device.
Is there such an example that make the hub as a child of the host controller
and control its power?

OK. I will remove it.
