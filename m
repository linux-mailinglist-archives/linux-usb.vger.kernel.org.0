Okay, so we may have different configurations:
 1 interface + 1 GPIO (N or M pins)
 4 interfaces + 1 GPIO (N or M pins)

Can those functions be changed at run time? Or is it simply one time settin=
g?

Yeah, but it's custom grown (I believe due to historical reasons, i.e.
there was no pin controller framework at that time) approach.
If pin functions may be changed at run time, it's better to have them
described as pinmux.

Yep, and this is pinmux functionality, no?

If you get a warning, yes, it's better to resolve it.
