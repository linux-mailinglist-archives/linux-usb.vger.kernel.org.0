Ah, I see and agree. Considering work is only deferred from restore_state()
I don't even think we need a flag, no? We can let parport_prologue()
just flush_work() unconditionally (right before taking the disc_mutex)
which for the most part will be idle anyway. The flush_work() also becomes
saner now that we'll stop rescheduling work in send_deferred_urbs().

Also, but not strictly related to this. What do you think of deferring all
work in write_parport_reg_nonblock() unconditionally? I'd like to avoid
that mutex_trylock() because eventually I'll be re-adding a warn in the
locking code, but that would also simplify the code done here in the
nonblocking irq write. I'm not at all familiar with parport, but I would
think that restore_state context would not care.

How did this thing ever work?

Thanks,
