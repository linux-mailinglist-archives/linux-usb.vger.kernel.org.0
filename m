Thanks, so in a nutshell the issue looks something like:

[827586.220071] xhci_hcd 0000:01:00.0: WARN Cannot submit Set TR Deq Ptr
[827586.220087] xhci_hcd 0000:01:00.0: A Set TR Deq Ptr command is pending.
[827723.160680] INFO: task usb-storage:93 blocked for more than 122 seconds.

The blocked task is probably because xhci driver failed to give back the
URB after failing to submit a "Set TR Deq Ptr" command. This part should
be fixed in:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210820123503.2605901-4-mathias.nyman@linux.intel.com
which is currently in usb-next, and should be in 5.15-rc1 and future 5.12+ stable.

This is probably one cause for the "Warn Cannot submit Set TR Deq Ptr A Set TR
Deq Ptr command is pending" message.
Another possibility is that with UAS and streams we have several transfer rings
per endpoint, meaning that if two TDs on separate stream rings on the same 
endpoint both stall, or are cancelled we could see this message.

The SET_DEQ_PENDING flag in ep->ep_state should probably be per ring, not per
endpoint. Then we also need a "rings_with_pending_set_deq" counter per endpoint
to keep track when all set_tr_deq commands complete, and we can restart the endpoint  

Anyway, my patch linked above together with this patch should make these errors
a lot more harmless.

Let me know if you can trigger the issue with both these patches applied.

I'll add your patch to the queue as well.

Thanks
-Mathias
