I understood that this is a requirement from Johan, he wrote (on May
12th in this thread):

The original approach was to submit these URBs in .attach (e.g. during
probe time) and kill them in .detach

usb_serial_generic_open() doesn't use the tty internally - which is
why passing NULL doesn't matter now (but who knows what's going to
happen in future, so better move away from it).

I can either submit the urbs myself or use usb_serial_generic_submit_read_u=
rbs()

CH348 provides up to 8 serial ports using these four endpoints, so
multiplexing is going on:
- one bulk out for TX (see struct ch348_txbuf)
- one bulk in for RX (see struct ch348_rxbuf)
- one bulk out for CONFIG handling (see struct ch348_config_buf)
- one bulk in for STATUS handling (see struct ch348_status_entry)

My understanding is that io_edgeport is submits the URBs that are
shared across ports outside of .open/.close.
So this will be a question for Johan: am I still good with the
original approach - or can you convince Greg that a different approach
is better?

From what I've seen during my tests:
- we fire the URB with TX data
- the device receives it and puts the data into a per-port TX buffer
- it indicates that it's done processing the URB
- the TX buffer is then written out (the host can move on do something else=
)
- the device signals to the host (via the STATUS endpoint) that it has
written out all data from the TX buffer

With that timeout logic my understanding is that they're trying to
catch cases where the last step (STATUS signal) did not work (for
whatever reason) so that the host can continue sending more data.

The original approach when upstreaming the ch348 driver was just to
submit TX URBs (without any custom code, just letting usb-serial core
handle it).
Corentin and Nicolas even wrote test programs to help reproduce issues
we've seen with the initial driver versions.
In other words: I don't know how to simplify our (to be upstreamed)
version without breaking something :-(

Also I'm not paid for this driver (at all - that also includes payment
per line of code), so there's no incentive there ;-).


Best regards,
Martin
