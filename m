So do those others also audit the static analysis tools to ensure that
they actually work as they "think" they do?  If not, then their
requirement is pretty pointless :)

Watch out, sending patches to subsystems to "fix" issues that really
are not real problems is a sure way to get your patches rejected and
make maintainers grumpy.

I recommend starting out with code that we all "know" needs help, in
drivers/staging/ for stuff like this, so you can learn the process
better, as well as start to understand the limitations of your tools
better.

good luck!
