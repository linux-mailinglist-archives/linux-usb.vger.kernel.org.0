Instead of the above is_pcie thing, can you split it so that the PCI parts
live in pci.c and the "platform" parts live in platform.c (or perhaps this
is fauxbus now). Then the core part of the NHI code (nhi.c) just works
regardless of how the controller is wired to the SoC.

There are plenty of examples in the kernel how to do this.

Call it qcom.c. But please try to move all the non-PCI generic parts into
platform.c and then only the Qualcomm specific things live in qcom.c. Idea
is that we can re-use all that when for example Apple Silicon support is
added and so on.

Got it, thanks for the explanation.

I it hard to change these DT bindings later on? If yes then I would
definitely think forward and make this support MSI from the get-go.

The former. The TB driver needs to setup tunnels before native protocol
stacks and their drivers (e.g PCIe and the like) resume. We have the
device_link from the native "port" / device to the NHI that deals with it
but it expects the property to be there.

Okay I'm not too familiar with the current DT bindings.

It should be something (eventually at least :-)) that allows us to describe the
USB4 ports and on-board retimers (to make it possible to upgrade firmwares
on those even if there is no link). But also if there is "embedded link"
device router.
