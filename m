On the Raspberry Pi 4, after a PCI reset, VL805's firmware may either be
loaded directly from an EEPROM or, if not present, by the SoC's
co-processor, VideoCore. This series adds support for the later.

Note that there are a set of constraints we have to consider:
 - We need to make sure the VideoCore firmware interface is up and
   running before running the VL805 firmware load call.

 - There is no way to discern RPi4's VL805 chip from other platforms',
   so we need the firmware load to happen *before* running
   quirk_usb_handoff_xhci(). Failure to do so results in an unwarranted
   5 second wait while the fixup code polls xHC's non-existing state.

By Florian's suggestion I've been spending some time exploring the device
link[1] API in order to see if that could save us from explicitly creating
probe dependencies between pcie-brcmstb and firmware/raspberrypi (patch #3).
Technically these dependencies could be inferred from DT. It turns out Saravana
Kannan has been looking at this already. A new boot mechanism, activated with
fw_devlink=on takes care of the device probe ordering on devices with
consumer/supplier relationships. For now this relationship is created based on
the usage of generic DT properties, but has no support for vendor-specifc DT
properties, which we'd be forced to use in order to create a relationship
between our two devices since our setup is highly non generic. There will
probably be at some point support for such properties, and we will then be able
to revisit some of this code.

All this is based on the work by Tim Gover in RPi's downstream
kernel[2].
