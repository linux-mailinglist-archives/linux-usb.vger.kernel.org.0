Indeed, it is well known that the problem of finding all errors or bugs 
by static code analysis is Turing complete.

No.  I would take such patches from anyone, but depending on what _I_ 
consider not obvious enough.

I have already accepted it.  In fact, the patch was my suggestion in the 
first place.

When I originally wrote this code, I was aware that it was somewhat 
subtle, but at the time it didn't seem to warrant a comment or 
explanation.  Sudip's patch has changed my mind.

As with many other comments, its purpose is to explain a somewhat 
obscure aspect of the code -- something which is there by design but 
isn't immediately obvious to the reader.  That is the added value.

Agreed.  In this case, the new comment does a pretty good job of telling 
people using the tool that the finding is unjustified.

If you are suggesting some sort of special code annotation that the tool 
would understand, I am open to that.  But I'm not aware of any even 
vaguely standard way of marking up a particular function call to 
indicate it will not return an error.
