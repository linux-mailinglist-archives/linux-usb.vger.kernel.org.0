The spec and the CM guide "imply" this behaviour as far as I can tell,
so that the "sleep event" is done completely once started. I guess this
can be interpreted differently too because it is not explicitly said
there.

Can you ask AMD HW folks if this is their interpretation too? Basically
when we get "Sleep Ready" bit set for all the routers in the domain and
turn off power (send PERST) there cannot be wake events until that is
fully completed.

There is typically a timeout mechanism in the BIOS side (part of the
power off method) that waits for the PCIe links to enter L2 before it
triggers PERST. We have seen an issue on our side that if this L2
transition is not completed in time a wake event triggered but that was
a BIOS issue.

We do have pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() there but I guess that's
not called for integrated PCIe endpoints such as xHCI and the USB4 Host
Interface. They too enter D3cold once power is turned off so I agree we
might have gotten lucky here with the D3hot 10ms delay.
