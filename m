Thanks for the comment.

I (probably wrongly) assumed that urb::transfer_buffer_length was the
allocated length and urb::actual_length was what was actually being
transferred. Right now, I am just confused. Seems that I need to study
a bit more and understand the real purpose of
urb::transfer_buffer_length because I still fail to understand in
which situation this can be different from the allocated length.

I do not follow you on this comment. usb_free_coherent() does not have
a reference to the URB, right? How would it be supposed to retrieve
urb::transfer_buffer_length?


Yours sincerely,
