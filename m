Interesting you mention extcon-usb-gpio. I thought extcon at least from
bindings perspective is passé now. Maybe this is what you need (just
landed in usb-next):

usb: common: add USB GPIO based connection detection driver
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git/commit/?h=usb-next&id=4602f3bff2669012c1147eecfe74c121765f5c56

dt-bindings: usb: add binding for USB GPIO based connection detection driver
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git/commit/?h=usb-next&id=f651c73e71f53f65e9846677d79d8e120452b59f

Fortunately this new driver might check the right boxes for you:
- usb connector binding
- ID detect GPIO
- vbus-supply regulator

With that, I think you can also keep the connector subnode out of the
SSPHY node well, and similarly get rid of the vbus toggle handling from
the PHY driver.

The big thing missing now is that this driver replaces extcon
completely, so we'll need handling in dwc3/dwc3-qcom to retrieve the
role switch state to know when host mode is entered. I saw this a while
back but don't think it got picked up:
