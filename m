will update, though it's not unlikely it will go stale again before this
series lands.

It's a leftover from the early days of the series, when the driver had
it's own binding, I'll remove it.

Not sure about that, the rts5411 binding could exist without this driver.

Will change to 'usbdev_dev' node as suggested, I think it's ok to keep
'udev' for the pointer to the USB device itself, since that abbreviation
is used commonly in USB kernel land.

ok, I plan to revert the suggested logic though and bail out 'early' if there
is nothing to do.

Indeed, will use of_parse_phandle() instead

Yeah, it seems that race could happen. IIUC we could use device_is_bound()
to check if probing completed, really_probe() calls driver_bound() only
after successfully probing the device.

It shouldn't be necessary, when the platform device is destroyed it
unbinds the associated USB devices (see onboard_hub_remove()), hence
they don't keep using the drvdata. There was a related discussion in
the early days of this series: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/9/21/2153

That would limit pdev_list to a single entry, which is not what we want. A
parent hub might have multiple compatible onboard hubs connected to it.

yes, will change to of_parse_phandle()

The evolution of this driver somewhat tied it to xHCI, however that
isn't strictly necessary. In a sense it is nice when 'companion-hub'
is mandatory, since things can get messy if it is forgotten when it
should be there.

The property should be mandatory in the bindings of the USB >= 3.0
hubs that are supported by this driver, but it could be optional
for USB 2.0 hubs. Instead of doing the enforcement in the driver
it could be limited to checking a DT against the bindings in .yaml.
It's also an option to make it mandatory in the driver through a
list of compatible strings / VIDs/PIDs.

it feels a bit sneaky to do it after creation instead of probe(), but I guess
it's fine.

right, will call of_platform_device_destroy() in case of failure

Could catch, it seems I limited testing to a single removal ...
