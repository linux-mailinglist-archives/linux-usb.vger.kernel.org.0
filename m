What's that issue, specifically?

No need to be sorry,  now I know what this really is about. :-)

I'm not against this patch, but I IMO the "motivation" part of the
changelog needs to be improved.

If the final goal is to get rid of device_add_properties(), please
spell it out and say what problems there are with it and why the new
function will be better.
