Me neither. :-)

That said complexity has grown since then and there are the
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND and DPM_FLAG_LEAVE_SUSPENDED flags that can be
used to control that behavior to some extent.

Setting DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND alone, in particular, causes
pm_runtime_set_active() to be called at the noirq stage of device
resume either by the core or by bus types (e.g. PCI) etc.

It looks like ohci-platform might use DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND, but I
need to take a closer look at that (possibly later this week).

Cheers!
