Hi Daehwan,

Even if we call runtime idle versus suspend, if the device is still in
the disconnected state, it should call the runtime PM suspend routine
after the autosuspend timer expires.  As Alan mentioned already, this
allows not blocking the caller for the entire DWC3 suspend sequence to
execute. (DWC3 core will suspend other components as well, such as PHYs)

Also, for legitimate cases where pullup is actually called to start
enumeration from a suspended state, I'm not sure if the short duration
between RS set and re-suspend (due to your patch) is enough time for the
host to actually detect the device connected.

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
