Nobody rejected your patch.  We pointed out problems with it, and we 
asked you to take a second look and provide more information.  You never 
replied.

That's not right.  Your changes were never merged into the kernel, in 
any form.

What is there to reconcile?  Your patch and my commit touched different 
code and addressed different (although similar) problems.  More 
specifically, your patch made changes to these routines:

	find_next_descriptor()
	usb_parse_ssp_isoc_endpoint_companion()
	usb_parse_ss_endpoint_companion()
	usb_parse_endpoint()
	usb_parse_interface()

whereas my commit changed:

	usb_get_bos_descriptor().

Furthermore, the changes you made appeared to be unnecessary (you added 
checks for things that either had already been checked or were checked a 
few lines later), whereas my commit fixed an actual bug, as demonstrated 
by syzbot.

Indeed, I did _not_ write that patch the same day as your submission.  
If you check the datestamps on these emails in the archive, you'll see 
that my patch was posted on May 13 2019 and yours was posted on May 14, 
the next day:

What subsequent patches?
