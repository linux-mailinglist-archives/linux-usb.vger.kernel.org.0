(as you highlighted one below)  Else, I can note an assumption somewhere that soc-usb supports playback only and add the capture path when implemented.

>> Ok, I think the problem is that I'm interchanging the port and device terminology, because from the USB perspective its one device connected to a USB port, so its a one-to-one relation.  Removing that mindset, I think the proper term here would still be "port," because in the end SOC USB is always only servicing a port.  If this is the case, do you have any objections using this terminology in the Q6AFE as well as ASoC?  I will use consistent wording throughout SOC USB if so.

Remember, this is technically the term used to explain the channel created for ASoC to communicate w/ USB.  If we use a term like "device," USB devices come and go, but this ASoC path won't be unallocated along with the USB device, since it does service/know about all the available USB devices connected to the system. (ie through usb hubs)
