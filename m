Ok, good.

But again, that is completely irrelevant. As I've said numerous times
now, this is about what the hardware is capable of, not which
functionality a particular OS chooses to use.

Ok, but you still need to explain why dropping hs_phy_irq is correct.

Until there's a clear answer to that, it seems we need to include it.
