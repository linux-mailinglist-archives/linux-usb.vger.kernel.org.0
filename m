You really should be asking people who work for Amazon.  I suspect that 
nobody who regularly reads this mailing list knows the answer.

(If you look through the MAINTAINERS file, you'll find there are a few 
kernel developers who do work for Amazon, or at least, have @amazon.com 
email addresses.  Try asking some of them.)

But even if the Kindle firmware gets changed (which I doubt will 
happen), we would still want to support all the old devices that aren't 
running the updated firmware.
