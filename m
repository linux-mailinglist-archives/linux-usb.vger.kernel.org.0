So we have a DWC3 controller on a PCI bus, somehow described in DT, but
the refclock is derived from something that's not described as a clock
in the OS?

As long as there's a technical reason why this needs to be described,
this would be a property.

I'm not familiar with the details of these adjustments, but from what
you describe your suggestion sounds very reasonable to me.

For things that are generic yes, but otherwise the general guideline is
that things should be human readable with standard units (whenever
possible).
