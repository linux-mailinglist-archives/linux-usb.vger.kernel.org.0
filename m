You are correct, but I think I am just preserving the broken behaviour
that we have today :)

I was just keeping the original lock type.

Good point, I missed that for some reason, will fix.

It saves a function call, so yes, you are right, will fix that up.

Nope, looks wrong.

That's the main problem here, I kept the existing locking "scheme" which
was only half-there.

I'll make this a mutex and add locking everywhere to properly protect
the lists.

For some reason I thought that we needed to free the memory before it
could be used, but given the locking issues, this could break, you are
correct.

I'll go back and redo the locks here to properly be held everywhere, and
just be a mutex to make things simpler, thanks so much for the review!
