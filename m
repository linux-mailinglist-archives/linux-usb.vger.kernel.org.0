I guess we can postpone for 5.15.  The patch was written for the code
on linux-next, and I see there have been a few code clean up there.

But the patch itself could be applied to Linus tree with a slight
fuzz, so the stable backport should be fine.

If it's still not cleanly applicable, let me know.  I'll refresh the
patch for whatever preferred branch.
