I looked at the logs and here is what I found:

Scenario 1:
   dmesg-faux bus-device bound-auto resume.log
   dmesg-platform bus-device bound-auto resume.log

In this case suspend bailed out way before driver suspend
when vhci_hcd is using platform and faux bus.

Freezing remaining freezable tasks failed after 20.006 seconds (0 tasks refusing to freeze, wq_busy=1)
Restarting kernel threads ... done
OOM killer enabled.
Restarting tasks ... done.
random: crng reseeded on system resumption
PM: suspend exit

Auto-resume of the user-space worked. Scenario 1 isn't really
interesting.

Scenario 2:
   dmesg-faux bus-device bound-black screen.log
   dmesg-platform bus-device bound-black screen.log

Even though the result is the same in seeing blank screen, how
we get there is different.

=================
faux-bus device:
=================
- suspend worked - looks like
   usb 4-1: PM: calling usb_dev_suspend @ 6054, parent: usb4
   usb 4-1: PM: usb_dev_suspend returned 0 after 13675 usecs
   usb usb4: PM: calling usb_dev_suspend @ 6055, parent: vhci_hcd.0
   usb usb4: PM: usb_dev_suspend returned 0 after 9 usecs

vhci_hcd suspend isn't in play here. usb_dev_suspend() returns.
See below

usb 4-1: PM: usb_dev_suspend returned message.

-------------------------------------------------------------

- resume started (assuming it has been initiated by user)

[  650.027491][ T6056] pci 0000:00:01.0: PM: pci_pm_suspend_noirq returned 0 after 304 usecs

See see timestamp difference between the last suspend message and the
first resume message.
[  674.000257][   T39] pci 0000:00:00.0: PM: calling pci_pm_resume_noirq @ 39, parent: pci0000:00

usb 4-1 usb_dev_resume never returns.

[  674.071125][ T6117] usb usb4: PM: usb_dev_resume returned 0 after 21110 usecs
[  674.113991][ T6126] usb 4-1: PM: calling usb_dev_resume @ 6126, parent: usb4

-------------------------------------------------------------

=====================
platform bus device
=====================

- suspend was aborted because vhci_hcd suspend routine returned error

[  297.854621][ T9402] usb 4-1: PM: calling usb_dev_suspend @ 9402, parent: usb4
[  297.868524][ T9402] usb 4-1: PM: usb_dev_suspend returned 0 after 13214 usecs

[  297.876774][ T9394] vhci_hcd vhci_hcd.0: PM: failed to suspend: error -16

- the following triggers resume
[  297.877321][ T9394] PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected

[  297.881065][ T9403] usb usb3: PM: usb_dev_resume returned 0 after 19 usecs

[  297.905148][ T9418] usb 4-1: PM: calling usb_dev_resume @ 9418, parent: usb4

usb 4-1 usb_dev_resume never returns.

Note - In both cases, usb_dev_resume doesn't return. When it is called is the
difference.

I don't think suspend/resume works when devices are bound. Suspend exits and
starts resume which seems to fail because it doesn't handle the virtual usb
device resume. There is a missing piece here.

When vhci_hcd imports a device and acts as a proxy between the virtual mass
storage device (e.g in this case) - it appears suspend and resume are
handled as if it is a usb device. Maybe this is incorrect?

usb_dev_suspend() works and usb_dev_resume() on these virtual usb devices?
Do we need to handle this in usb_dev_resume()?

Talking out loud - I have to do some looking into.

thanks,
