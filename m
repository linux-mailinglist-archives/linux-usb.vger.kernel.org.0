Hi Rob,

The "port" node is going to be the connection to the usb role switch
device, which will be listening for the USB type C port change events.
(i.e handling USB role events, etc...)  In previous patches, this was
part of the connector node, which may not have made much sense, as the
connector model is used to describe the HW connections within a design.
 The role switch endpoint is more of a SW interaction between drivers,
thus the motivation to remove it from the connector node.

I think the current usb-connector design is OK as it is, since the only
component essentially involved in the SS path is the SS MUX that we've
been discussing, and this is true among designs that are supporting SSUSB.


Thanks

Regards,
Wesley Cheng
