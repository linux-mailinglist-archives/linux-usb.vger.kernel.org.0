Adding a few more instances.

Editing Source Caps on the fly is also applicable for handheld devices
with just  one port !
For instance, the phone might want to conserve power and limit the
power supplied to the port partner by adjusting the source caps to
limit battery drain based on the system conditions.

The sink caps can potentially change on the fly as well based on the
charging phase the handheld device is in. For instance, in the last
phase of charging (say when the battery is charged to greater than
80%), it would not make much sense to step down voltage(power losses
due to conversion) from greater than 5V to battery voltage(say ~4.4V).
