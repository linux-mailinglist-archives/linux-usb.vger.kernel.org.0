It feels like we have to accept that we are going to represent the USB
2 and USB 3 parts separately?  From Alan's response it sounds as if,
at least in theory, there can be different hierarchies leading up to
them.  That kind of thing seems like it'll be hard to deal with unless
we accept that the USB2 and USB3 nodes are separate, right?

I'm certainly not wedded to the above representation, so let's drop it.

Are you saying that's not a goal?  I'd still be happiest with allowing
it to be split amongst multiple nodes.

So in the case that it's under the USB bus, how do you envision the
i2c part probing?  I guess you'd add a "i2c-bus" property and provide
a phandle to the i2c bus?  ...and, presumably, the device address on
that i2c bus?  I know you pointed to examples of "ddc-i2c-bus" but I
don't think this is exactly the same because we need to specify a bus
plus a device address.  Did I miss an example where something like
this is already done, or are we inventing something new?

I mean, the thing that would make me happiest is to allow the
different parts of this device to be described in different places, as
Matthias's patch does.  In other words, I agree with you that the best
solution is to have nodes for hubs under the USB bus.  I'm still of
the opinion that the device is best described by _also_ having a
separate node for the control logic part of the IC either under the
i2c bus or at the top level.  In the i2c case, at least, this avoids
coming up with a different way to specify a device that is a child of
an i2c bus.


So, just to summarize, I guess options still being discussed:

a) Only represent the hub under the USB controller, not anywhere else.
If the hub is also on an i2c bus, invent a new way to specify which
bus it's under and what address it's using.  Add some sort of
pre-probe stage and have the hub driver register for it so it can turn
on the power, which might be needed in order for the USB devices to be
detected and probed normally.

b) Give up trying to model this and just whack in a regulator and some
logic in the xhci-platform driver to do this.

c) Decide that it's OK to represent the control logic as a separate
node, either under an i2c bus or at the top level.  Use phandles to
link.  Basically, I think this is nearly Matthias's current patch.


Did I miss anything that's currently under proposal?
