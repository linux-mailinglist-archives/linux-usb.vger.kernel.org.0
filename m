I think it was your messages that I saw on IRC of aarch64-laptops
then. Can confirm both HPD on tlmm, and lack of any i2c devices on
newly created virtual bus.

That was my conclusion as well. Would you mind following up with them,
if they could disclose the amount of voltage supplies the IC is
expecting? if it's 1 or 2, it's rather easy to bruteforce all unused
pin combinations. If it's more than that, it's only reasonable to
enable all unused GPIOs to high at once, which I wouldn't do tbh :)

The weird thing is that according to a rather simplified publically
available diagram, HPD is actually propagated through the PS185,
implying that bridge is on. It could be that IC requires multiple
supplies, hence Aux bus is not working, but in my experience these
devices typically don't start until all of the required supplies are
up.

I think, you would also need to enable usb_1_ss2 combo phy, afaik only
mdss3 (for eDP) has a dedicated DP phy, for the rest it's a combo
qmpphy. Konrad could probably confirm?
Once i2c/aux works, maybe we would also need a small driver to set phy
to DP mode, as afaik pmic-glink handles these. Just hypothesis though.
I have tried adding a dummy "dp-connector" like you did, but as a
child node to pmic-glink, hoping that it would handle the alt mode,
but it is probably not that easy :)

Would be happy to cooperate on debugging this offline.
