Background: I need to differentiate between on-board and external USB
devices on a few boards.  Although hubs can indicate the removable
status of each port, the configuration options are often limited and may
not be capable of describing the actual wiring.  Also, if a device is
hard-wired directly to a host port, there is no way of indicating this.

While I could match the full device path using per-board lists, I'd
prefer a generic solution.  To this end, it is necessary to add the
ability for DT to supply this information.  Three variants have been
discussed:

1. Add a "non-removable" property to the USB device node similar to how
   it's done for MMC.

2. Add a "non-removable-ports" property to the hub node.  Apparently
   ACPI can supply the information in this manner.

3. Make any USB device with a DT node implicitly non-removable.

Either one will work for me.
