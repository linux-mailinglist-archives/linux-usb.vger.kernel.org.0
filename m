Thanks! I meant also enable control channel tracing as explained in the
above linked page so we could maybe see the hotplug packet coming from
the lane adapter too. Anyhow,

// As here too.

It would be interesting to see what ACPI does here, I mean enabling
dynamic debugging of acpi_device_set_power() and friends. One suspect is
that when the runtime suspends happens, the power resource or _PS3()
gets called to put the device into D3cold and it has some sort of
Sleep() inside. This allows the OS to relese the CPU to do other things
too according to ACPI spec (and Linux does this) so now when you plug in
the device the GPE triggers wake and Linux starts processing that one.
We see the above runtime resume but then the Sleep() in the _PS3()
completes and cuts the power from the NHI while we are in the middle of
resuming it already (or something along those lines).

We saw similar "context switch" happening when PCIe L2 failed, BIOS
implemented the timeout using Sleep() that allowed Linux to process
other things which resulted unexpected wake (not the same as here
though).

So one thing to check too is how the ACPI methods get called and
especially if they somehow end up messing with each other.

Oh, indeed it is.

Okay thanks for checking.
