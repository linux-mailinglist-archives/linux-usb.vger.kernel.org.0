Need a SPDX line here, instead of the license boiler-plate text you
have.

Did you run checkpatch on this thing?  I thought that would have told
you about this.

Dual licensing a USB host controller driver is, um, a very dubious
thing given that you can only interact with symbols exported with
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() from the USB stack.

So you might want to change this...

If not, and you want to keep the dual license, I need some explaination
from a legal person at your company included in the changelog text, and
a signed-off-by from them as well.

thanks,
