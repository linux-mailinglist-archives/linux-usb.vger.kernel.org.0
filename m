I agree with your reasoning. Even though today these bugs can not happen 
since appropriate hardware and its drivers do not fail in a "necessary" 
way ever, this can suddenly change in the future. Maybe it will not be 
so easy to track the root causes especially taking into account that 
failures happen very seldom.

I am unready to make any considerable changes in the API. Also, as I 
mentioned before, it would be better if a bunch of appropriate fixes 
will be prepared by somebody who involved in development of the Linux 
kernel much more than me and who can automatize the process of finding 
such issues using static analysis tools. Most likely those tools are 
able to find all such places very quickly even for drivers on very 
specific architectures. I added Dan to the discussion since he is a 
developer of one of such tools.
