Hmm. Does your device use a legacy USB2 PHY (not generic PHY) driver,
and does it implement the usb_phy_set_power() callback? Because
otherwise this new configfs_composite_reset() callback would not have
changed from the original behavior since the newly introduced (in patch
1/3) dwc3_gadget_vbus_draw() callback would simply be a no-op if
dwc->usb2_phy is not present.

If it does turn out to be something with your PHY driver's set_power(),
it's still puzzling since it's directed to only the usb2_phy, so I'm
curious how telling it to draw 100mA could affect SSP operation at all.

Thanks,
Jack
