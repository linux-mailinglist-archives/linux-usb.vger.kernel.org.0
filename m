I see, can we maybe avoid the actual resizing by commenting out the
following writel() calls, but let the fifo resize logic calculate the EPs?

void dwc3_gadget_clear_tx_fifos(struct dwc3 *dwc)
{
...
		/* Don't change TXFRAMNUM on usb31 version */
		size = DWC3_IP_IS(DWC3) ? 0 :
			dwc3_readl(dwc->regs, DWC3_GTXFIFOSIZ(num >> 1)) &
				   DWC31_GTXFIFOSIZ_TXFRAMNUM;
		/* Comment the dwc3_writel() */
		//dwc3_writel(dwc->regs, DWC3_GTXFIFOSIZ(num >> 1), size);

and

static int dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos(struct dwc3_ep *dep)
{
...
	/* Comment the dwc3_writel() */
	//dwc3_writel(dwc->regs, DWC3_GTXFIFOSIZ(dep->number >> 1), fifo_size);
	dwc->num_ep_resized++;

Those 2 writel() would be the one that actually programs the TXFIFO
register.  I hope when commented out, no resize should actually happen
anymore.

With this, hopefully we can get some logs from the device at least :)

Since SDM845 does technically support txfifo resize downstream, let me
see if I can figure out what is different on this particular device
after getting the logs.
