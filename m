Hi Felipe/Alan,

Thanks for the detailed explanations and inputs.  Useful information to
have!

I mean...I'm not against using the synchronize_irq() +
dwc3_gadget_disable_irq() route, since that will address the concern as
well.  It was just with the disable/enable IRQ route, I didn't need to
explicitly check the is_on flag again, since I didn't need to worry
about overwriting the DEVTEN reg (for the pullup enable case).  Will
include this on the next version.

Thanks
