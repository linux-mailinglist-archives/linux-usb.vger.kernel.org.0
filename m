Not sure whether I get this comment. The patch wasn't copied. Maybe you were
expecting me to CC amelie.delaunay@st.com ? if so, just now CC'ed.

The behavior would be the same as "not-supported".

v8 version[1] of the patch was using uint32. I moved to using strings
as you were asking to unify with the approach in [2]. Since [3] was using
string enums, I moved to that. I don't have a strong preference here, so
I can move back to using u32 if you feel so.

This is a mistake on my part. v8 of the patch which had
new-source-frs-typec-current
defined as uint32 were making use of these constants. Now that
new-source-frs-typec-current
is a string, these constants dont have any more significance in the binding.
Will remove in the next version of the patch.

> perhaps they should be. Are these numbers from the spec or made up?
Yes they are from the spec and are from "Table 6-14 Fixed Supply PDO - Sink"
of "USB Power Delivery Specification Revision 3.0, Version 1.2". Not made up.
