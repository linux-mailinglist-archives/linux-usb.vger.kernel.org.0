Heh.  Assuming the device file you tell the test program to use 
corresponds to an actual USB device, you can trigger a disconnect by 
literally unplugging the USB cable.  (Add a 10-second delay to the 
program to give yourself enough time.)

Unfortunately, I don't have any big-endian systems either.
