But my point is that this claim isn't factually correct; there has never
been a need to check for short *writes* (even if a few drivers have such
redundant checks).

Just drop the bit about "short writes".

Even this is disputable; in some situations the usb_control_msg() is
still preferred as I hope my comments have shown.

Perhaps they are better described as "convenience wrappers" or similar
as the real gain from using these helpers is to replace a pattern like:

	f(data, ...) {
		buf = malloc(data);
		usb_control_msg(..., buf, ...);
		memcpy(data, buf, ...);
		kfree(buf);
	}

for when data is on the stack *and* you do not expect variable-length IN
transfers.

But as soon as a driver is able to reuse a single buffer for multiple
transfers or the data buffer is already DMA-able, usb_control_msg() may
still be a better choice.
