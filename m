That is not all. The additional UVC_STREAM_ERR tag on the sentinel
request can be set optional by the host driver. But by spec the
userspace application has to drop the frame when the flag was set.

With my proposal this flag will be set, whenever we find out that
the currently transferred frame was erroneous.

Exactly, this is why we have to somehow finetune the timedelay between
requests that trigger interrupts. And also monitor the amount of
requests currently enqueued in the hw ringbuffer. So that our drivers
enqueue dequeue mechanism is virtually adding only the minimum amount
of necessary zero-length requests in the hardware. This should be
possible.

I am currently thinking through the remaining steps the pump worker has
to do on each wakeup to maintain the minimum threshold while waiting
with submitting requests that contain actual image payload.

This is not totally true. We saw partially rendered jpeg frames on the
host stream. How the host behaves with broken data is totally undefined
if the typical uvc flags EOF/ERR are not used as specified. Then think
about uncompressed formats. So relying on the transferred image format
to solve our problems is just as wrong as relying on the gadgets
hardware behavior.

I think there is no way around time constraints. Since the gadget
hardware is introducing interrupt latency, we have to address with
the sentinel request and some well adjusted amount of zero-length
requests.
