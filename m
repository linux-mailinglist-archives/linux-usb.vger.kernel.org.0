There will not be similar problems in the future as you are explicitly
setting everything to 0, so all should be fine :)

The real issue here is that the usbtmc logic of sending data is crazy,
and unique to it for various reasons that well all really don't
understand.  Given the very small number of these devices in the world,
it's probably best left to the maintainers of it to handle any real
problems going forward, and just squash these types of fuzzing bugs now
with a heavy hammer to make them happy.
