We are talking memory-mapped io here, so it cannot just be "re-used", it
is wat it is. I guess the PCI BAR could be released and then the physical
address the resource was at could be re-used for another piece of MMIo,
but AFAIK outside of PI=CI hotplug we never release BARs.

Maybe we need to ref-count resources and have the aprent free only be
a deref and not release the resource until the child resource also
is free-ed doing another deref?

I must say that to me it sometimes just seems like always allowing unbind
is a bad idea. Another example of this is things like virtio, where
we can have a filesystem based on virtio-block, but the virtio interface
between the hypervisor and the guest-kernel is a PCI-device and in theory
the user could unbind the virtio driver from that PCI-device, after which
the whole house comes crashing down.

I also know that the extcon framework in its current incarnaton
does not deal with unbind properly...

Maybe it is time that we allow drivers to block unbind instead of
trying to support unbind in really complex situations where normal
use-cases will never need it ?

I do realize unbind is very useful for driver developent without
rebooting.

1) make resources refcounted, have child resources take a ref on the parent
2) Disallow unbind on devices with bound child-devices?
