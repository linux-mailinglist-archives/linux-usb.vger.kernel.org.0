Actually it's a very similar reason for the gadget drivers.  When 
connected to other machines and using the USB4 networking feature (like 
a host to host communication) the Linux kernel will identify itself and 
the other side will show that to a user.

So right now it's got some hardcoded values.  This thread was prompting 
to change the strings, but it's brought about the realization that we 
should also be using a Linux specific vendor (the one uses in gadget 
devices) and then a Linux specific "device id" which you will allocate.

Hope that helps!
