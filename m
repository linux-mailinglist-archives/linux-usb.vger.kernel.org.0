Hi Noralf,

I was happy to see v4 - thanks for accepting so much of my feedback -
and I have to say that the new recursive acronym makes me smile! :)

Just a thought: Maybe LZ4_COMPRESS should be optional also on the host?

Ie. not select it here and make lz4 code conditional on CONFIG_LZ4_COMPRESS?

Should this be gud-y instead, like in other drm/*/Makefile ?

This always returns 0, so could be void?

Watch out for endianness bugs.

I'd suggest to stay with the pattern "little-endian on wire" and add
complexity on the host to deserialize/convert transfered data to native,
but perhaps with some generic method that scales better than explicitly
converting values on every use.

The above line seems unneccessary since USB_DIR_OUT is 0 by spec.

Is buf neccessary here? This isn't the hot path, but less dynamic memory
and copying is always nicer.

It seems like this checks overlooks endianness, which happens very easily.

Maybe it's a good idea to create a function to fix endianness directly
after data transfers?

Such a function could take a pointer to memory and a kind of format
string made up of 'b', 'w', 'l' and 'q' or '1', '2', '4' and '8' to
describe field sizes, and would then convert wlq fields to native
endianness in-place.

Or are there some parts of the code that could really benefit from
keeping wire-endian values in host memory?

Ouch, kmalloc for a single byte here, this is the extreme case! :)

If it's not cool to transfer data directly through to the provided pointer
then how about bouncing onto a stack variable rather than kmalloc memory?

Ie:

u8 val;

gud_usb_control_msg(.. GUD_REQ_GET_STATUS, 0, &val, sizeof val)

Also not the hot path, but is there no way to avoid copying memory around?

USB devices are usually expected to only support one protocol as advertised
by the device using some combination of bcdDevice in the device descriptor
and bInterfaceProtocol in interface descriptor(s), while the host is expected
to handle the complexities of different versions - so something like this
where the host instructs the device about versions isn't typical for USB.

The motivation behind that split is that USB devices are typically
simpler and lower cost than USB hosts, so devices should try to be
trivial to implement.

You can of course keep it anyway if you really want, I'm just letting
you know about the common pattern.

Just a note here that split transfers are not per se a big problem if
they are all submitted at once, since the USB host controller is able
to schedule different transfers back-to-back on the wire.


Kind regards
