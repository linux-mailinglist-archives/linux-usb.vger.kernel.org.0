You know, I was going to say Yes, but now I think you're right; it's not 
needed in dummy_udc_stop.  This is because core.c always calls 
usb_gadget_disconnect before usb_gadget_udc_stop.  And we can rely on 
this behavior; it's obviously necessary to disconnect from the host 
before stopping the UDC driver.

On the other hand, while checking that fact I noticed that 
soft_connect_store in core.c doesn't call synchronize_irq in between the 
other two, the way usb_gadget_remove_driver does.  That seems like a bug 
-- if it's necessary to synchronize with the IRQ handler on one path, it 
should be necessary on the other path as well.  But that's a matter for 
a separate patch.
