I see.  Thanks for the explanation; it makes sense now.  The patch
description should explain this too.

Wouldn't it be better to add a field containing the device address to
struct usb_device?  And also export it, either in sysfs or debugfs?  
It seems like the kind of thing that might be important for debugging.  
If we did this then the usb_hub_clear_tt_buffer API wouldn't need to be
changed.
