The above is what I wanted to say ->

-> but this isn't.  In particular, I messed up the RESTORE part, so it
should read:

Otherwise, it will return "true" if the current transition is *not*
RESTORE (in which case all devices would be resumed) *and*
power.must_resume is not set (so this particular device need not be
resumed).

Sorry about that.

That should include the power.may_skip_resume flag, so as to read as follows:

Unless MAY_SKIP_RESUME is unset or power.may_skip_resume is unset for
at least one of its descendants (or dependent devices).

And analogously here, so what I really should have written is:

And if the device was not in active use before suspend (as per its
usage counter) or MAY_SKIP_RESUME or power.may_skip_resume is unset
for at least one of its descendants (or dependent devices in general).

In fact, this is part of the implementation and it helps to
"propagate" the "must resume" condition to the parent and the
first-order suppliers of the device (which is sufficient, because
their power.must_resume "propagates" in the same way and so on).

IOW, the important piece is what the return value of
dev_pm_skip_resume() should be in particular conditions and that
return value is computed with the help of power.must_resume (and it
might have been computed in a different, possibly less efficient,
way).

Sorry for failing to be careful enough ...
