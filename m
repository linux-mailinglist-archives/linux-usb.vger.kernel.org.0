I agree it should be doable. Looks like prior to 0d3a97083e0c ("usb:
dwc3: Rework clock initialization to be more flexible") the core did
support specific clocks ("ref", "bus_early", "suspend"), but was
changed to use a simpler devm_clk_bulk_get_all() call.

Yea, just need to make sure "ref" clk is specified in the DT node. Then
in the driver you can just iterate through dwc->clks and try to find one
with .id=="ref". If clk_get_rate() succeeds then you can use the value
to calculate the GUCTL.REFCLKPER and GFLADJ register fields.

Or perhaps even use a lookup table, since according to the DWC3
programming guide only 6 refclk frequencies (16, 17, 19.2, 20, 24, 39.7
MHz) are supported so that might be simpler than a few integer divide
operations that would otherwise be required.
