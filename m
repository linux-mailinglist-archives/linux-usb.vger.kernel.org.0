Hmmm.  I might be inclined to move the start of the I/O-protected
region a little earlier.  For example, the first
blocking_notifier_call_chain() might result in some memory allocations.

The end is okay; once bus_remove_device() has returned the driver will 
be completely unbound, so there shouldn't be any pending I/O through 
the device.
