Thanks for the pointer, it's good to see another attempt to sort out
power sequencing.

The pwrseq framework could potentially be used by the onboard_usb_hub
driver, but it probably can't replace it completely. Besides powering
the USB hub on before enumeration the driver also can optionally power
it off during system suspend when no wakeup capable USB devices are
connected, which can result in signifcant power savings on battery
powered devices. For this the driver needs knowledge about the USB
(hub) devices that are provided by a hub chip. That part is probably
best implemented by a driver under drivers/usb/.

It might be an option to have the USB core and the onboard_usb_hub
driver use the pwrseq framework, though we'd have to ensure that it
isn't a problem that the USB core turns power on (before
enumeration) and the onboard_usb_hub driver turns it off during
system suspend (and on again on resume).
