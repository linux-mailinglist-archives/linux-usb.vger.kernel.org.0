I just tried running the experiment on my system.  I enabled wakeup for 
the mouse device, made sure it was disabled for the intermediate hub and 
the root hub, and made sure it was enabled for the host controller.  
(Those last three are the default settings.)  Then I put the system in 
S3 suspend by writing "mem" to /sys/power/state, and when the system was 
asleep I pressed one of the mouse buttons -- and the system woke up.  
This was done under a 6.12.10 kernel, with an EHCI host controller, not 
xHCI.

So it seems like something is wrong with your system in particular, not 
the core USB code in general.  What type of host controller is your 
mouse attached to?  Have you tested whether the mouse is able to wake up 
from runtime suspend, as opposed to S3 suspend?
