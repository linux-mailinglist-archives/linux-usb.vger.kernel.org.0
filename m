This problem occurs in real testing environments with low probability
when the UAS device is unplugged during data transmission. Current
patches have been tested and can resolve this issue. However, as
Oliver mentioned in his response, if the resetting flag is set to 1
at this time, it might prevent scsi_done() from being called, which
was not considered in Patch V1.

Submitted URBs will be processed through usb_disable_endpoint()
during device removal, eventually triggering usb_kill_urb() in the
usb_disconnect() workflow. This will invoke the completion interface
through usb_hcd_giveback_urb(), returning -ESHUTDOWN to the UAS driver.

After applying the current patch, testing has shown that failed commands
in the UAS driver for which scsi_done() was not called after submission
will be completed 30 seconds after a SCSI command timeout occurs.
We will optimize this issue in patch V2, which is currently under testing.

Dear,

Sorry for the delayed response to this issue.We anticipate
uploading an updated patch V2 next week.
