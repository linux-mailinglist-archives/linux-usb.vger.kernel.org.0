Doing it at a device level is the only sane way to do this.

A user needs to say "this device is allowed to be controlled by this
driver".  This is the trust model that USB has had for over a decade and
what thunderbolt also has.

What do you mean by "driver init"?  module_init()?

No driver should be touching hardware in their module init call.  They
should only be touching it in the probe callback as that is the only
time they are ever allowed to talk to hardware.  Specifically the device
that has been handed to them.

If there are in-kernel PCI drivers that do not do this, they need to be
fixed today.

We don't care about out-of-tree drivers for obvious reasons that we have
no control over them.
