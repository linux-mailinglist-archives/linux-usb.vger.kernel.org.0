That mitigates the issue somewhat, however we still have to convince Rob that
both references are needed.

Registration is trivial and the driver code will be needed anyway, I'm
pretty convinced that a separate platform driver will be simpler than
plumbing things into the hub driver, with the additional checks of who is
suspended or not, etc. If other resources like resets are involved there
could be further possible race conditions at probe time. Another issue is
the sysfs attribute. We said to attach it to the primary hub. What happens
when the primary hub goes away? I guess we could force unbinding the peers
as we did in the driver under discussion to avoid confusion/inconsistencies,
but it's another tradeoff.

My view of the pros and cons of extending the hub driver vs. having a platform
driver:

- pros
  - sysfs attribute is attached to a USB hub device
  - no need to register a platform device (trivial)
  - potentially more USB awareness (not clear if needed)

- cons
  - possible races involving resources between peer hubs during initialization
  - increased complexity from keeping track of peers, checking suspend order
    and avoiding races
  - peers are forced to unbind when primary goes away
  - need DT links to peers for all USB hubs, not only in the primary
  - pollution of the generic hub code with device specific stuff instead
    of keeping it in a self contained driver
  - sysfs attribute is attached to only one of the hubs, which is better than
    having it on both, but not necessarily better than attaching it to the
    platform device with the 'control logic'

So yes, there are tradeoffs, IMO balance isn't as clear as your comment
suggests.
