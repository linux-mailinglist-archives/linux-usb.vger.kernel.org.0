The de-facto standard for how to handle change requests for
non-supported features (e.g. changing the I/O port or IRQ) is to simply
ignore them and return 0.

For most (non-legacy) serial devices the only relevant parameters are
close_delay and closing_wait. And as we need to return -EPERM when a
non-privileged user tries to change these, we cannot drop the test.

(And returning -EOPNOTSUPP was never correct as the ioctl is indeed
supported.)
