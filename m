Hi Felipe,

Thanks for the feedback.  I agree, the TX FIFO resizing logic should be
reviewed carefully to, in order not to cause any regressions.  Would you
be willing to shed some light on some of the failures you've seen
previously where the gadget drivers stopped working?  (would help
possibly come up with better approaches, etc...)

The flag was going to serve the purpose of allowing platforms to define
if they want to enable the TX FIFO resizing logic or not.  Maybe in
their particular HW platform, the HW default FIFO settings are sufficient.

It should be acceptable, as the function drivers shouldn't be calling
usb_ep_enable() until we receive a SET_CONFIG from the host to enable
the configuration.  __dwc3_gadget_ep_enable() -->
dwc3_gadget_set_ep_config() is where we'd assign the EP to a particular
TX FIFO.

Yes, that is a valid concern.  At the moment, if we returned -ENOMEM due
to the resizing logic failing, then the function driver would receive an
error during usb_ep_enable().  This would then most likely result in the
data path not being enabled for each subsequent function driver.  Would
the situation be better if we avoid binding to the UDC entirely if our
TXFIFO was out of memory?

Thanks again for the input!
