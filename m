What you refer is the call of prepare_trbs and ep_cmd. This is probably
pretty fast. But we still do this up to 16 times on one interrupt run.
To really tell the weight in that case we will have to come back with
numbers.

Good.

I was not aware that this mode (Multiple Interrupt Support) is even possible
with dwc3. So if I really want to get the per ep hanlder patch to be mainli=
ne
it really needs to make use of that feature.

So we really need to come up with some interface for the user of the
complete handlers. So the upper layers won't be informed that the
amount of work is critical and therefor could need a separate thread.

(At least this should be documented)
