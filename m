+      value will be 0x0 (the default). The value for this property needs to be chosen very
+      carefully after consulting with your IC engineer.
+
+      On most ChipIdea platforms, the "usage_tt" flag at RTL is 0, so this property only affects
+      siTD.
+
+      If this property is not set, the maximum packet size is 1023 bytes, and if the total packet
+      size for previous transactions is more than 256 bytes, no further transactions can be
+      accepted within the frame. The use case is single transaction, but higher frame rate.
+
+      If this property is set, the maximum packet size is limited to 188 bytes and more
+      transactions than in the above case can be handled. Transactions will be accepted as long as
+      188 bytes or more of space are left within a frame. Software needs to make sure it does not
+      send more than 90% maximum_periodic_data_per_frame. The use case is higher amount of
+      transactions at the cost of a lower frame rate.

-	"nvidia,tegra124-udc"
-- reg: base address and length of the registers
-- interrupts: interrupt for the USB controller
-
-Recommended properies:
-- phy_type: the type of the phy connected to the core. Should be one
-  of "utmi", "utmi_wide", "ulpi", "serial" or "hsic". Without this
-  property the PORTSC register won't be touched.
-- dr_mode: One of "host", "peripheral" or "otg". Defaults to "otg"
-
-Deprecated properties:
-- usb-phy:      phandle for the PHY device. Use "phys" instead.
-- fsl,usbphy: phandle of usb phy that connects to the port. Use "phys" instead.
-
-Optional properties:
-- clocks: reference to the USB clock
-- phys: reference to the USB PHY
-- phy-names: should be "usb-phy"
-- vbus-supply: reference to the VBUS regulator
-- maximum-speed: limit the maximum connection speed to "full-speed".
-- tpl-support: TPL (Targeted Peripheral List) feature for targeted hosts
-- itc-setting: interrupt threshold control register control, the setting
-  should be aligned with ITC bits at register USBCMD.
-- ahb-burst-config: it is vendor dependent, the required value should be
-  aligned with AHBBRST at SBUSCFG, the range is from 0x0 to 0x7. This
-  property is used to change AHB burst configuration, check the chipidea
-  spec for meaning of each value. If this property is not existed, it
-  will use the reset value.
-- tx-burst-size-dword: it is vendor dependent, the tx burst size in dword
-  (4 bytes), This register represents the maximum length of a the burst
-  in 32-bit words while moving data from system memory to the USB
-  bus, the value of this property will only take effect if property
-  "ahb-burst-config" is set to 0, if this property is missing the reset
-  default of the hardware implementation will be used.
-- rx-burst-size-dword: it is vendor dependent, the rx burst size in dword
-  (4 bytes), This register represents the maximum length of a the burst
-  in 32-bit words while moving data from the USB bus to system memory,
-  the value of this property will only take effect if property
-  "ahb-burst-config" is set to 0, if this property is missing the reset
-  default of the hardware implementation will be used.
-- extcon: phandles to external connector devices. First phandle should point to
-  external connector, which provide "USB" cable events, the second should point
-  to external connector device, which provide "USB-HOST" cable events. If one
-  of the external connector devices is not required, empty <0> phandle should
-  be specified.
-- phy-clkgate-delay-us: the delay time (us) between putting the PHY into
-  low power mode and gating the PHY clock.
-- non-zero-ttctrl-ttha: after setting this property, the value of register
-  ttctrl.ttha will be 0x7f; if not, the value will be 0x0, this is the default
-  value. It needs to be very carefully for setting this property, it is
-  recommended that consult with your IC engineer before setting this value.
-  On the most of chipidea platforms, the "usage_tt" flag at RTL is 0, so this
-  property only affects siTD.
-  If this property is not set, the max packet size is 1023 bytes, and if
-  the total of packet size for pervious transactions are more than 256 bytes,
-  it can't accept any transactions within this frame. The use case is single
-  transaction, but higher frame rate.
-  If this property is set, the max packet size is 188 bytes, it can handle
-  more transactions than above case, it can accept transactions until it
-  considers the left room size within frame is less than 188 bytes, software
-  needs to make sure it does not send more than 90%
-  maximum_periodic_data_per_frame. The use case is multiple transactions, but
-  less frame rate.
-- mux-controls: The mux control for toggling host/device output of this
-  controller. It's expected that a mux state of 0 indicates device mode and a
-  mux state of 1 indicates host mode.
-- mux-control-names: Shall be "usb_switch" if mux-controls is specified.
-- pinctrl-names: Names for optional pin modes in "default", "host", "device".
-  In case of HSIC-mode, "idle" and "active" pin modes are mandatory. In this
-  case, the "idle" state needs to pull down the data and strobe pin
-  and the "active" state needs to pull up the strobe pin.
-- pinctrl-n: alternate pin modes
-
-i.mx specific properties
-- fsl,usbmisc: phandler of non-core register device, with one
-  argument that indicate usb controller index
-- disable-over-current: disable over current detect
-- over-current-active-low: over current signal polarity is active low.
-- over-current-active-high: over current signal polarity is active high.
-  It's recommended to specify the over current polarity.
-- power-active-high: power signal polarity is active high
-- external-vbus-divider: enables off-chip resistor divider for Vbus
-- samsung,picophy-pre-emp-curr-control: HS Transmitter Pre-Emphasis Current
-  Control. This signal controls the amount of current sourced to the
-  USB_OTG*_DP and USB_OTG*_DN pins after a J-to-K or K-to-J transition.
-  The range is from 0x0 to 0x3, the default value is 0x1.
-  Details can refer to TXPREEMPAMPTUNE0 bits of USBNC_n_PHY_CFG1.
-- samsung,picophy-dc-vol-level-adjust: HS DC Voltage Level Adjustment.
-  Adjust the high-speed transmitter DC level voltage.
-  The range is from 0x0 to 0xf, the default value is 0x3.
-  Details can refer to TXVREFTUNE0 bits of USBNC_n_PHY_CFG1.
