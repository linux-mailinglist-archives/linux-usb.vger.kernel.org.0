I agree, leaving D3cold means "applying power to the device", and PCIe
r6.0, sec 6.6.1, says that's a Fundamental Reset:

  A Fundamental Reset must occur following the application of power to
  the component. This is called a Cold Reset.

So we need a delay similar to what we do in
pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus().  I don't know whether that is
supposed to happen somewhere on the ACPI side or in the PCI side, but
my inclination would be the PCI side because the delay isn't really
platform-specific, it's specified by the PCI specs, and the OS needs
to manage the RRS Software Visibility retries and features like
Readiness Notifications.

pci_set_low_power_state() contains corresponding delays for putting
devices in D1, D2, and D3hot.

Maybe the D3cold -> D0 delays should be in
platform_pci_set_power_state()?  I think pci_power_up() is the only
caller that sets the state to D0, and it assumes the device is
Configuration Ready when platform_pci_set_power_state() returns:

  pci_power_up
    platform_pci_set_power_state
    pci_read_config_word(PCI_PM_CTRL)

So I think we need basically the same delays and pci_dev_wait() stuff
in this path.
