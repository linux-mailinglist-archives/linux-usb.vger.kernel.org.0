Quick answer: I don't know.  I can't think of any good reason.  This
code was all written a long time ago.  Maybe the issue was overlooked
or the details were misunderstood.

It persists until the driver cleans up the queue.

Like I said, a long time ago.

The hw_alt_next field should be updated for all the qTDs in the URB.
Failure to this was probably an oversight.  Or maybe the omission was
to simplify the procedure for cleaning up the queue after a short
transfer.

I'd have to review the details of ohci-hcd and uhci-hcd to make
sure.  In principle, the queue isn't supposed to stop merely because
of a short transfer unless URB_SHORT_NOT_OK is set.  However, the UHCI
hardware in particular may offer no other way to handle a short transfer.

I don't understand what you're saying in this paragraph.  What do you
think USB device drivers are supposed to be managing?  The URB buffer
size?  They should set that field without regard to the type of host
controller in use.

In short, the behavior you observed is a bug, resulting in a loss of
throughput (though not in any loss of data).  It needs to be fixed.

If you would like to write and submit a patch, that would be great.
Otherwise, I'll try to find time to work on it.

I would appreciate any effort you could make toward checking the code
in qh_completions(); I suspect that the checks it does involving
EHCI_LIST_END may not be right.  At the very least, they should be
encapsulated in a macro so that they are easier to understand.
