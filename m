We don't allow D3 on hotplug bridges because:

		/*
		 * Hotplug ports handled natively by the OS were not validated
		 * by vendors for runtime D3 at least until 2018 because there
		 * was no OS support.
		 */
		if (bridge->is_hotplug_bridge)
			return false;

And we don't allow D3 on older non-hotplug bridges because:

		/*
		 * It should be safe to put PCIe ports from 2015 or newer
		 * to D3.
		 */
		if (dmi_get_bios_year() >= 2015)
			return true;

However we must allow D3 on *Thunderbolt* bridges to take advantage
of power savings.  So the following check is an exception of the
above-stated rules:

		/* Even the oldest 2010 Thunderbolt controller supports D3. */
		if (bridge->is_thunderbolt)
			return true;

This is most likely necessary for AMD Thunderbolt as well, but
could be achieved by adding another check to pci_bridge_d3_possible()
which returns true for the USB4 class.

That's a quirk needed for older Thunderbolt controllers.  It could be
replaced by a check for the device IDs listed in 493fb50e958c.

It most likely does not affect AMD Thunderbolt.

This could be replaced by a DMI check for the affected MacBook Pro
models.  Those happen not to possess a Thunderbolt controller,
so checking for Thunderbolt presence seemed simpler and more clever
at the time...

I can produce a list of affected models if you want.

This does not affect AMD Thunderbolt.

External eGPUs are not supposed to be managed by vga_switcheroo
(which is only responsible for switching between a chipset-integrated iGPU
and an on-board discrete dGPU), that's what these checks are for.

This does affect AMD Thunderbolt.

Same as above.

That wasn't introduced by me, so not sure what the rationale is.

Let me know if I can help clarify things further so that we can
find a solution that you feel more comfortable with.

Thanks,

Lukas
