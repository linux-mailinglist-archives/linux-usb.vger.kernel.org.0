I can see this causing more problems in the future.  There's no hint in 
include/linux/usb.h that any of the values it defines are part of a user 
API.  If they are, they should be moved to include/uapi/linux/usb/.

In general, if a user program depends on kernel details that are not 
designed to be part of a user API, you should expect that the program 
will sometimes break from one kernel version to another.

Yes, I know Linus insists that kernel changes should not cause 
regressions in userspace, but the line has to be drawn somewhere.  
Otherwise the kernel could never change at all.
