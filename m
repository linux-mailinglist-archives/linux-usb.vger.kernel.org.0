As I tried to point out earlier, this kind of binding change is
unhelpful.  Yes, you now have extra code in future Linux kernels that
works around the problem.  But other consumers of device trees
(U-Boot, other OSes) will have to add similar code or keep using older
device trees.  And even then it will still cause frustration for users
that want to run older kernels.

I do understand that it is sometimes necessary to change device tree
bindings.  But changes like this one just cause a lot of pain without
a significant technical benefit.

Cheers,

Mark
