It's pretty much the same thing, a "mux" function vs. individual
function calls.  Personally, individual callbacks are much more
explicit, and I think make it easier to determine what is really going
on in each driver.

But it all does the same thing, if there's going to be loads of
callbacks needed, then a single one makes it easier to maintain over
time.

So it's up to the maintainer what they want to see :)
