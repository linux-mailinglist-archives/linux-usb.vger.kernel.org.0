Ack, will do.

Yes, chromium reviews (userspace code that shall use the new
attribute) happen over gerrit, and so the publicly available links
would be googlesource.com.

Ack, will do.

One question: Under Greg's latest suggestion, the decision to show
this attribute does not have to be bus wide / device_type wide i.e.
subsystem can choose for this attribute to show up only under certain
devices. So if it is more preferable, I can have this attribute show
under ONLY PCI devices that attach below "external-facing" PCI devices
(and any other PCI devices will not have this attribute show up at
all). I guess this sounds better than having "unknown" show up on the
rest of the devices that are not removable?

Ack, will remove the blank line (didn't know that blank lines between
variables and code is not preferred).
