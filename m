Hi Martin (and Corentin),

and sorry about the late reply here.

Ok, thanks for confirming, sounds like that's how the device works then.

It would only be to really confirm that this is how the vendor protocol
and device works. Your call.

Right. I think the io_edgeport driver maintains some kind of TxCredits.
I guess that's related, but not sure how relevant that is here (and you
probably shouldn't based anything on that old driver directly anyway).

Not sure what Corentin has been preparing, but yeah, you need some kind
of deferred mechanism to make write() non-blocking and hold off sending
more data to the device until you're sure there's room in its buffers. I
guess a workqueue should do fine.
