I suggested doing it before ->prepare so that subsystems can clear
power.may_skip_resume in their ->prepare callbacks.  If you think the
ability to do that isn't important then fine, initialize the flag
before ->suspend.

I was trying to implement your suggestion of making the default for
power.may_skip_resume be the return value of dev_pm_skip_suspend().  
However, making the default value be "true" is indeed simpler, and I
think it would work okay.

I'm not so sure about that.  The existing PM core code doesn't ever get
into a situation where it tries to set a device's runtime status to
"active" while the parent's status is "suspended".

But the core _does_ need to care, because if somebody else fails to
take care of the suspend side then the core would trigger the WARN() in
pm_runtime_enable() for the parent device.  I guess we could consider
such a WARN() to be a symptom of a bug in the driver or subsystem,
rather than in the core; is that how you want to handle the scenario
above?

This approach doesn't seem robust.  I can easily imagine cases where
the parent's driver is aware of SMART_SUSPEND but the child's driver
isn't.  Currently we don't require the child's driver to call 
pm_runtime_resume().  Do you really want to consider all such cases to 
be bugs?

Basically, I'm saying that if the core allows things to arrive at a
situation where we can come out of THAW with a runtime-suspended parent
and a runtime-active child, it really should be considered to be the
core's fault.
