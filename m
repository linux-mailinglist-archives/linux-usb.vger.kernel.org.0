The problem with that idea is that is the code needs to
merge the output of two values or split an integer as nnn.nn
then it needs to do something different from the 'normal' code.

If the buffer is always PAGE_SIZE the why not embed it in
a structure.
The generated code will be the same, but it will be absolutely
explicit that the size is PAGE_SIZE if the code filling in the
buffer decides it needs to check.
