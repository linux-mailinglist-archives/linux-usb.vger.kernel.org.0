Do you get "functionfs read size 512 > requested size 24, splitting
request into multiple reads" message when problems happen?

Is there anything in the kernel log?

I'm unable to reproduce your problems. I thought I was able, but
it was another problem, which is fixed with:

5acb4b970184d189d901192d075997c933b82260
dwc2: gadget: Fix completed transfer size calculation in DDMA

(or you can simply take upstream drivers/usb/dwc2).

Do your problems happen on dwc2 or dwc3?

Is there a way to try your adb without building and running the
whole Android?

Andrzej
