Really?  I got rid of the crazy nesting, it should be more obvious what
is happening here now:

"otherwise" makes no sense here, it's obvious that if the buffer isn't
big enough we need to pass through and keep parsing.

The switch case is broken out here, so let's unindent the next block:

This should make it more obvious.

at least it is to me now, it's much easier to read, and gcc should also
be happy about it.

Parsers are a pain, you have to handle stuff like this in messy ways.

Personally, I'm horrible at parsers, but this really looks to be the
simplest way to write this code at the moment.

Johan, any thoughts?
