Removing the find_tt() will mean a major rework of the code.

If it is wrong later due to some code change then I guess someone will
need to send a patch to correct the comment.

I am failing to understand why will you not be able to check its
validity later. You just need to read the code to check it.

I dont think it is a false positive. The error return value is not
checked and that is true. Only that it is not applicable because of
the way the coding is done.

I think tools will always give you some false positives and you will
need to read the code to know if its false positive or not. I dont
think there is any tool yet which will only give true positives.
