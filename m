this comment is irrespective of your below comment (If we were to 
support Control Peripheral where the local DWC3 controller has the 
signals routed away entirely, then I think we would need to look into 
modelling that in device tree - and using an overlay to show the DWC3 
controller going away in Control Peripheral mode and coming back. )?

Will look into this example, but seems this driver uses both extcon and 
usb-role-switch for notification.

Did not comprehend this comment fully. if possible can you give some 
example.

Yes that is correct understanding.

Not sure what is it mean by "Can the Arm core see the hub"?

Its debug mode which we are supporting in driver.

Can you please help what you mean by "so that the Arm core never has to 
deal with the situation where the USB connector "goes away""

debug mode is set run time via user, i will check how we can model such 
scenario where device tree corresponding to a h/w module is only valid 
in some scenario at run time. if possible please elaborate bit more on 
your suggestion

you mean we should document that this driver works in debug mode only? 
not clear on where one should pass "debug" and "bypass" string?

I will also be discussing modelling EUD as typec connector with USB 
folks and will come back soon with clarity on this. Thanks for your 
valuable comments and suggestions.
