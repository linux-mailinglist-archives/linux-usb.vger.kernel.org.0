The copyright change is still not correct.  I recommend you take a look
at this:
	https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/copyright-notices-in-open-source-software-projects/
and:
	https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/open-source-licensing-basics-for-software-developers/
	(the copyright chapter)
for specifics as to what to, and not to do with regards to copyright
notices.

I'm sure your employer also has some information about what to do with
regards to this as well.

I've taken patches 1-3, 5-9 now.

thanks,

greg k-h
