You can run anything you want at device-plugin-time in userspace by
writing a udev rule, that's exactly what that was designed for.  The
policy you decide is under your control in userspace, no need to do
anything special in the kernel at all.

If you do not support "non-standard" devices, your operating system will
not be used by anyone in the real-world as there are TONS of
"non-standard" devices out there, sorry.

try it and see, go to the local store and buy a shopping cart of cheap
mice and keyboards and see what happens...
