Oh! That is a new perspective I did not consider.

With the definition of UVC_STREAM_ERR by spec, the uvc_video driver
would in no case set this header bit for the current frame on its own?
Is that correct?

I can fully reproduce this with linux and windows hosts. For linux
machines I saw that the host was taking the FID change as a marker
to see the previous frame as ready and just rendered what got through.
This did not lead to garbage but only to partially displayed frames
with jpeg macroblock alignment.

Right.

That was also my thought about five minutes after I did send you the
previous mail. So sure, this is no real issue for the host.

Ack. This should already solve a lot of issues.

For this I would still suggest to move the usb_ep_queue to be done in
the pump worker again. Its a bit back and forth, but IMHO its worth the
extra mile since only this way we would respect the dwc3 interrupt
threads assumption to run *very* short.

Agreed, but this needs a separate scoped undestanding of the host side
behaviour over all layers.

What do you mean by drop?

I would suggest to immediatly switch the uvc_buffer that is being
enqueued and start queueing prepared requests from the next buffers prep
list. As suggested, the idea is to have per uvc_buffer prep_list
requests which would make this task easy.

Ack

This roadmap sounds like a good one.
