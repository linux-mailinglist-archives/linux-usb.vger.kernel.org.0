A flag isn't strictly needed, no, but it could be used to avoid some of
the flush_work() overhead for every parport callback. The restore-state
work will typically only be queued once.

Sounds good to me. As long as the state is restored before submitting
further requests we should be fine. That would even allow getting rid of
write_parport_reg_nonblock() as you can restore the state using
synchronous calls from the worker thread. Should simplify things quite a
bit.

The shadow registers are initialised at probe so as long as you don't
switch to a different parallel-port driver without disconnecting the
mos7715 in between it works.
