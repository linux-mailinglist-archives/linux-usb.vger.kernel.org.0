If you hot-remove the XHCI controller, accesses to its MMIO space
will fail.  xhci_irq() seems to perform such MMIO accesses.

Normally this should happen silently and MMIO accesses just return
with a fabricated "all ones" response.  Chances are however that the
Aardvark controller raises a synchronous external abort instead.
Perhaps you can teach it not to do that.

Thanks,
