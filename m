Well, order of suspending is selectable by the user.  It can be either 
asynchronous or reverse order of device registration, which might pose a 
problem.  We don't know in advance which of two peer hubs will be 
registered first.  It might be necessary to introduce some additional 
explicit synchronization.

Not all hubs would need this.  Only ones marked in DT as having a power 
regulator.
