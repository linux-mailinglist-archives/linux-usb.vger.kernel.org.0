Sorry, I totally missed responding to your mail in March. Seeing the most recent mails on this topic, let me answer the open questions:

Those are development boards for the first generation of Xilinx/AMD Zynq SoCs. The board is still listed in some online shops and should be readily available, however it's now nearly ten years old and probably not used a lot anymore as there are more modern SoCs available by now.

Right. Although I'm not sure if the board vendor has any chance to disable advertisement of that feature using that specific chip.

Seeing that there is now at least a second device suffering from this issue, it's maybe more wide spread than I thought. Introducing the proposed quirk for those chips would of course mean that other devices that use them and implement remote wakeup properly will not be able to make use of auto suspend. But that may be a smaller issue compared to having broken functionality on some devices.

I'll test your proposed patch with my board in the next couple of days.

Best regards,
Michael
