Hi Thierry, Hi Rob, Hi Kishon,
Please let me know your thoughts of the below implementation.

1. Add a "bool disable_gen2" to "phy->attrs" structure.
2. In _of_phy_get() of phy-core.c to add the follow to parse a generic property.

	phy->attrs.disable_gen2 = of_property_read_bool(args.np,
							"usb-disable-gen2");
3. In individual phy driver, to add SOC/PHY specific programming accordingly.

Thanks,
JC
