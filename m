I thought you said earlier that the port got into trouble while it was 
suspending, not while it was resuming.  You wrote:

> [ 2789.679812] usb 3-4-port3: can't suspend, status -110

So if the problem occurs during suspend, how can it be possible to avoid 
the problem by taking some particular action later while resuming?

The 0004 bit of wPortChange means that the suspend status has changed; 
the port is no longer suspended because the device attached to that port 
(your keyboard) issued a wakeup request.

You can't.  Only the hub itself can set the wPortChange bits.

Not timing.  It's because you woke the system up from the attached 
keyboard.
