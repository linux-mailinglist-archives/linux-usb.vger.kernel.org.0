The error messages in your log extract all refer to ehci-pci, which is 
the driver for a USB-2 controller.  They are completely unrelated to any 
problems you may be having with USB-3 controllers.

What makes you think that?  Do you have any evidence that the hub is 
receiving a STALL?  Indeed, the commit you referenced above specifically 
mentions that when MMF is set and the PID code is IN then it is not a 
STALL.

It certainly can't solve the problem for any USB-3 connections, because 
the patch doesn't touch any of the USB-3 driver code.

Can you collect a usbmon trace showing an example of this problem?

One possibility is to introduce a special quirk for the NEC uPD72010x 
EHCI controller.  But we should hold off on that until we know exactly 
what is happening.
