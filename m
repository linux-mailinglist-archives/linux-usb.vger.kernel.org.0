There was a similar case where the USB3 link had transitioned to a
lower power U1 or U2 state after resume, before driver read the state,
leaving port_remote_wakeup flag uncleared.

This was fixed in 5.1 kernel by commit:

6cbcf59 xhci: Fix port resume done detection for SS ports with LPM enable

Can you check if you have it?
It should be in recent stable releases as well.
