I already tested this case with two different machines. One is the
5.2-rc6 kernel with SG patch and the other is default fedora kernel
version 5.1.20-200.fc29.x86_64. As I said, I run vhci_hcd with SG
and usbip_host without SG and also vice versa.

I tested it with Sandisk USB 3.0 storage deivce and tested read and
write operation which transfer files whose size is over 1G like movie
file. All the opreations work well.

> 2. run usbip_test.sh

One thing goes wrong. But others except the one worked as expected.

My SanDisk device is bound port 8 but the test script detachs only
port 0 and 1. This error is not related with SG patch but we have to
modifiy the test script to try to detach all the ports.

My work is done. I will send it now.
