How about implementing "library" versions of show_authorized() and 
store_authorized() that the bus-specific attribute routines can call?  
These library routines would handle parsing the input values, storing 
the new flag, and displaying the stored flag value.  That way at 
least the common parts of these APIs would be centralized in the 
driver core, and any additional functionality could easily be added 
by the bus-specific attribute routine.
