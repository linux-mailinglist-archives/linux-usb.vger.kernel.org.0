is *not* cache coherent.

And to answer some of Greg's questions:

- This can show up on current HW that doesn't offer full IO coherency,
   which is likely on low-end arm/arm64 systems.

- I guess nobody noticed this before as x86 is perfectly happy with
   conflicting attributes for the same physical page, and there is
   (wild guess) probably not that much userspace making use of shared
   mappings between kernel and userspace using this interface.

Thanks,
