You are probably right about that. I do not understand USB protocol well
enough. Eliminating clearing TT buffers when split transaction is
incomplete fixed the problem for me. If I changed qtd_copy_status() to
return EPIPE as it was doing before commit 64cc3f12d1c7, USB resets went
away on my machine, so I am wondering if the comment at
drivers/usb/host/ehci-q.c:477 is applicable here.

Right. It solves the problem I see with USB 2.0 controller. I continue
to see issues with USB 3.0 if I move the hub to a USB 3.0 port.

Sure. I will do that. Tracing the code when debugging for USB 2.0
controller led me to that specific line of code. As I said, I do not
understand USB well enough to say if changing that code is the right
solution, and it indeed solves the problem for USB 2.0 only.

I do not believe whatever is causing USB resets is unique to NEC chip. I
am seeing issues on the USB 3.0 controllers as well.
