MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE mostly as I mentioned in my other reply.

We can go back to 1998 OpenFirmware and it's already there[1].
'usb,class9' for a hub. There's a few other variations defined.

I think in that case you'd generally want firmware to enable things
and the kernel then does no power control.

We have ~1500 boards using DT and maybe ~10 with USB devices described
in DT. So the whole thing is not common to begin with.
