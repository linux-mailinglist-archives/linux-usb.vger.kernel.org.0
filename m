Yes, that's what it looks like to me too.  Or maybe the suspend succeeds 
but then the device/controller immediately gets woken up again.

Can you provide the contents of /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices and also a 
usbmon trace showing a few rounds of this recurring activity?  Perhaps a 
section of the dmesg log with dynamic debugging enabled for the usbcore 
module, as well.
