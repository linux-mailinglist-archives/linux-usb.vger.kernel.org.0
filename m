Alan, first of all thank you for your feedback.

Do you know any practical way how to test this?

I understand what you mean here but isn't it primarily about downsizing
USB 2.0 -> USB 1.1?
The next point would be if eg. an endpoint of a webcam downsizes to 1.1
you don't have to expect a workable device because video would exceed
the bandwidth easily.
Do you know any practical example/hardware where this is really
relevant?

The failure handling will call the xhci reset which is not meant to be
run without fully initialized data structures. In my case the driver
returns -EPROTO (while the device is already disconnected), then first
of all it tries to reset the endpoint which in the upstream kernel
causes the NULL PTR exeption. For XHCI this code stream logic is simply
not meant to be applied in such an error.
My first submitted patch will solve the issue but just papers a higher
logic issue.=20

a bad CRC response on a short cable -  something has gone very wrong
then.
If there are temporary EMI issues ... I'd consider that an as an a
absolute failure as well, they
need to be handled in HW rather than a software workaround.

In my experience with USB anything that is a 'temporary' failure can be
considered as 'permanent' failure and I've really seen a lot over the
last 1 1/2 decades.
However issues are mostly related to immature controllers / missing
quirks for some controllers.
Our devices in the field since 2008 usually pump around 100-300mbit
through the USB 2 link,
streaming  devices which usually run for a long period of time (up to
months / years).
'retrying' something on a link where something has gone wrong for sure
never worked properly for me, it would have continued with another
followup issue at some point.

I'm definitely in favor of telling the user if something went wrong
either reconnect or submit a bug report for that particular device to
add some quirk for special handling.

Anyway can you give a particular example where this 'retrying'
mechanism and reloading the endpoint size solves or solved a problem?
Over the years people will certainly forget why this was implemented
and take the code 'as is'
and the next ones will just say it was always like that don't change.
I don't mind keeping it as it is but it should be more clear / obvious
why it's really done that
way.
