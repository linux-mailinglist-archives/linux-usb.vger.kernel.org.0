Sure, but a framework like this (probe/disconnect), really isn't USB,
it's just driver core stuff :)

Then let's not add bindings without a real user please.  We don't want
to maintain them for no good reason.

You can use the usb-gadget subsystem and dummy-hcd to create a loop-back
for a virtual USB device.  That's how syzbot does USB driver fuzz
testing, there should be some documentation on that somewhere in the
tree.
