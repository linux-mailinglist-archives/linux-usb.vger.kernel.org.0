It's not completely clear to me what it's meant for. If it was just
for fixing the type of the port to be sink, source or DRP before
connections, it would make sense, but since it can be use even when
there is an actice connection (there is nothing preventing that), it
can in practice be used to swap the role.

And in some cases in the past where this attribute file was proposed
to be used with some other drivers, the actual goal really ended up
being to be able to just swap the role with an existing connection
instead of being able to fix the type of the port. The commit message
made it sound like that could be the goal in this case as well, but
maybe I misunderstood.

Even in cases where it's clear that the intention is to just fix the
role before connections, why would user space needs to control that is
still not completely clear, at least not to me.

True. I stand corrected.

I don't know what's the intention with the port_type attribute file
unfortunately.

I get that, but that just means you want to fix the type during probe,
no? Why do you need to expose this to the user space?

Okay, I see. This is not a case for pr_set.

I'm still confused about the use case here. It seems you are not
interested in role swapping after all, so why would you need this
functionality to be exposed to the user space?

I'm sorry if I've missed something.

About the port_type attribute file itself. I would feel more
comfortable with it if it was allowed to be written only when there is
nothing connected to the port. At the very least, I think it should be
documented better so what it's really meant for would be more clear to
everybody.

thanks,
