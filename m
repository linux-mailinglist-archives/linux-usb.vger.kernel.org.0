Now that I think of it, aren't the numbers supposed to be in little endian
order?

In include/uapi/linux/usb/functionfs.h, descriptors and legacy descriptors
specify numbers as LE32, and below there is this sentence:

"All numbers must be in little endian order.".

And that is regardless of what endianness the machine running the gadget
uses. In other words, in the buffer passed through ep0 any numbers shall be
stored in such a way, that the least significant byte goes first.

The tables specifying the OS descriptors use general U16/U32 type, though,
but struct usb_os_desc_header says:

/* MS OS Descriptor header */
struct usb_os_desc_header {
	__u8	interface;
	__le32	dwLength;
	__le16	bcdVersion;
...

which is a strong hint that, in particular, bcdVersion _is_ little endian.

And a two-byte quantity of 0x0100 stored in little endian format looks like
this: 0x0001.

So it seems to me the correct thing to do is to ensure that the verifying code
works correctly both on big and little endian machines running USB gadgets,
rather than adding 0x0100 as a correct value and deprecating 0x0001.

Regards,

Andrzej
