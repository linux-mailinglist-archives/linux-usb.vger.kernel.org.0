I suppose you refer to something like the hub@1 and hub@2 nodes in the
example of this patch. This alone is not a suitable method in this case,
since the hub needs to be powered/initialized before it can be detected
by the USB bus and a driver could perform any initialization (a
chicken-egg problem)

I suppose in DT lingo you would say the 'system bus'. Under Linux
such devices are often represented as platform devices, 'connected'
to the pseudo 'platform' bus. It is the physical chip that has pins
to supply power, assert a reset or receive an input clock.

The problem is that the device is not probe-able without being
powered first.

Yeah, there have been a few attempts to solve this in the past,
unfortunately none of them was accepted, hopefully we can break this
pattern :)

For my specific use case only a single regulator needs to be turned on,
however that could be different for other hubs/configurations. So yes,
I think device specific code will be needed, but preferably not a
driver for every hub model/family.

Also the driver can optionally turn the power of the hub off during
system suspend, either always or only when no wakeup capable
descendants are connected, hence the driver needs to be aware of all
the USB hub devices that correspond to the hub chip.

The USB portion of the driver is currently a very thin layer, it essentially
(un)registers the USB devices with the main driver (the platform device)
and that's it. I received some feedback related with refcounting on the driver
patch, which I will incorporate.

Thanks
