Neither is needed here.

Using a valid mask is a new feature and isn't a prerequisite for adding
support for the GPIOs on cp2108. I've been meaning to implement that
since we started using it for ftdi_sio, and I'll be posting that
shortly.

The cp2108 pin configuration can't be changed at runtime, but even if it
was it's not clear what the pinctrl subsystem would buy us for a
hotpluggable USB device currently (even if devicetree could be used for
static topologies).

I'll look at the rest of this thread and the latest version of this
patch next week.
