I don't like that you create point where the support is temporarily
removed for this hardware. I know Guenter asked that you remove the
old driver in a separate patch, but I believe at that point you were
also proposing different config option name for the new driver, so you
could have removed the old driver only after you added the new one.

Since you now use the same configuration option name - which makes
perfect sense to me - I think you need to refactor this series. Maybe
you could first just move the old driver under drivers/usb/typec/tcpm/
in one patch, and then modify and slit it in another patch.

thanks,
