 From what I've seen I assumed that goal is to allow Offloading of 
specific stream from USB card. Otherwise I would say controls are not 
needed at all, as more user friendly solution is Offloading streams in 
order they are used as long as resources are available.

-EBUSY? and keep old value

(highlighted in [1])  However, IMO the current implementation assumes there is ASoC involved, which should mean that there is some platform "card" that is backing the offload path.  Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect, @Amadeusz.

I tend to agree, less values to change, less chance something breaks. 
However I think that there should be some way to disable Offload in case 
something doesn't work properly. (It doesn't have to be control, one can 
go with module parameter or sysfs toggle or something.)
