Isn't this scenario exactly what usb_modeswitch is supposed to do, in
userspace?  Various WWAN modems also require a vendor-specific command
(or a mass storage eject) to switch from driver CD mode into modem
mode, and all those are handled by usb_modeswitch.

In summary, does this really need to be in the kernel?
