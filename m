I am not saying you are using an "invalid id", or copying anything, see

We see devices that are "obviously" not the real vid/pid all the time in
the wild.  There's nothing "illegal" about another company using your
vid/pid, look at all of the ones out there already that use the FTDI
vendor id yet are "clones", same with pl2303 devices.

We also have fuzzing devices that spoof vid/pid pairs in order to test
kernel code, as well as being used as malicious devices to hack systems
or do other "fun" things.  Blindly trusting these numbers are something
we can no longer do.

The point being, while it is nice to trigger off of these values, beware
that it is not the only way that something like a userspace visable
change should trigger off of because this is something that a user wants
to have happen.  This also makes it easier as it "should" work for all
serial devices, and not be tied to specific hardware ids, requiring
kernel updates for new devices that want to do this.

hope this helps explain this a bit more.

Ah, for some reason I thought that newer POSIX releases finally defined
this, as vendors wanted that written down so they could "rely" on it.
Maybe not...
