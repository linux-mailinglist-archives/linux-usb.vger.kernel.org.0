No, ideally we should reject the input.

Looks like part of the problem are commits like 4cc7ecb7f2a6 ("param:
convert some "on"/"off" users to strtobool") which destroyed perfectly
well-defined interfaces.

Wow, that's pretty nasty.

Right, parsing is too allowing and there are too many ways to say
true/false.

The power-management attributes use 0 and 1 for boolean like I do here,
and I'd prefer to stick to that until we have deprecated the current
kstrtobool.
