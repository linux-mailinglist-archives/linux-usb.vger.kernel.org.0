Yeah I also had to smile when Simon Ser suggested it.

LZ4_COMPRESS is a tiny library so I'd like it to stay to keep things simple.

It needs to follow the struct drm_connector_helper_funcs.atomic_check
signature.

I follow USB here and use little endian for all request structures.
All req members are marked with __u8, __le16, __le32 or __le64.

For this particular request only the flags field needs treatment, like this:

	flags = le32_to_cpu(desc.flags);

The USB stack wants DMA capable buffers so it can't be avoided.

Thanks, I missed this one :)

I would like to avoid more layers and just use the leNN_to_cpu()
functions directly.

Everything on the wire should be little endian. Two reasons for this,
USB does it like that, and I don't think we will ever see a big endian
device. Or are there big endian microcontrollers maybe?

The USB stack needs the buffer to DMA accessible.
And a small buffer like this is likely to be available in the cache AFAIK.

I'm afraid not, but this is really fast though. Most buffers are smaller
than 32 bytes. The exception is EDID which is 128 or 256 bytes.

The device can just ignore this if they're not interested to work with
older drivers.
It's for devices that want to work with older drivers that don't support
the new protocol.

Not sure if there ever will be a version 2 of the protocol, but who knows.

This isn't a USB split transfer as such, it's the driver splitting up
the changed buffer rectangle because the device is unable to decompress
the entire buffer in one go (the lz4 compression method used doesn't
handle streams). This can kick in for devices that set
gud_display_descriptor_req.max_buffer_size. See gud_flush_work() for
details.
