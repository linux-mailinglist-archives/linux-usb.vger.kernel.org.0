Or maybe something like:

  This can be used to implement userspace policies tailored for
  user-removable devices.

Not sure exactly what "remove external PCI devices" means.  You're
talking about the *code* doing something, so I don't think it means
physically unplugging the device from the system.  Maybe preventing a
driver from binding to it or something similar?

I hesitate slightly to rely on URLs like googlesource.com in commit
logs because we don't know how long they will remain valid.  But I
guess there's no real alternative here, since this code probably
hasn't been posted to any public mailing lists like the ones archived
at https://lore.kernel.org/lists.html, right?

I think I would rather see this as:

  struct pci_dev *parent = pci_upstream_bridge(dev);

  if (parent &&
      (parent->external_facing || dev_is_removable(&parent->dev)))
          dev_set_removable(&dev->dev, DEVICE_REMOVABLE);

In other words, assume only that everything below an "external-facing"
device is removable.

In the absence of an "external-facing" property, we don't know
anything about the connection, and I'd rather use the default
(probably "unknown") instead of assuming "fixed."

I don't think we have anything that depends on "fixed," so I don't
think there's value in setting it.

(Note the blank line between local variables and the "if"; maybe
that's what Greg hinted at?)
