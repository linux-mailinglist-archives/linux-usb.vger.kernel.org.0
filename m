Hi Daehwan,

If this is an unexpected event where userspace initiates the UDC bind
sequence, then after the above sequence occurs, the DWC3 device should
still be able to re-enter runtime suspend after the autosuspend timer
expires.  Since the cable is disconnected, the dwc->connected flag would
still be false.  Is this not happening in your situation?

I'm just trying to understand what issue you're seeing other than the
momentary transition from runtime suspend (due to cable disconnect)
-->runtime resume (due to unexpected UDC bind) --> runtime  suspend (due
to nothing connected).

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
