If this fixes a bug, then please include the appropriate Fixes tag and
CC stable@vger.kernel.org. I'm guessing this is what the Fixes tag
should look like:

        Fixes: 48242e30532b ("usb: typec: fusb302: Revert "Resolve fixed power role contract setup"")

You probable also want to CC Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com> since
you are patching his code.

It still says "PATCH 07/15..." which means it's a part of a series,
no? So..
