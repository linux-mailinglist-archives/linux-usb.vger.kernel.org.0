Glad to hear you got it working. Did you confirm that you really need to
wait for THRE before submitting the next URB too? I don't see why the
vendor driver would be doing this otherwise, but perhaps it only affects
older, broken firmware, or something.

The TTY layer will assert DTR/RTS on open() and deassert on close() as
long as HUPCL is set. If you implement tiocmset() you can use that to
toggle the lines as well.

Got a link to the datasheet? Not sure what they refer to as TNOW.

I don't think the console code will assert DTR/RTS, you need to open the
port as a regular tty.

That should not be needed. It looked like the vendor driver had some
variant of the usual request to control the modem lines. That should be
all that is needed.

Look at the vendor driver implementation of ch9344_tty_tiocmset() and
ch9344_port_dtr_rts().
