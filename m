A Vendor ID read of a device in D3hot should definitely work.
Obviously if the device were in D3cold, we'd get no response at all,
so the requester should log a UR error and fabricate ~0 data.

But if the device starts out in D3cold and we power it up, it should
not go through D3hot.  The only legal transition from D3cold is to
D0uninitialized (PCIe r6.0, sec 5.8).

OK, so with [1] and patch 3/5:

  1) Initially the device is in D0

  2) We put it in D3cold (using some ACPI method) because the
  autosuspend delay expired (?)

  3) Plugging in the dock wakes up the device, so we power up the
  device (via pci_power_up(), which again uses some ACPI method), and
  it should transition to D0uninitialized

  4) With patch 3/5, pci_power_up() calls pci_dev_wait() because
  dev->current_state == PCI_D3cold

  5) I *assume* RRS SV is enabled (lspci -vv of Root Port would
  confirm this; maybe we should add a pci_dbg message about which
  register we're polling).  If so, patch [1] means we should poll
  Vendor ID until successful completion.

  6) pci_dbg log should confirm the device is ready with a "ready %dms
  after D3cold->D0" message, which would mean we got a successful
  completion when reading Vendor ID

  7) For debugging purposes, it would be interesting to read and log
  the PCI_PM_CTRL value here.  Per sec 2.3.1, the device is not
  allowed to return RRS at this point since we already got a
  successful completion.

  8) The USB4 stack sees the device and assumes it is in D0, but it
  seems to still be in D3cold.  What is this based on?  Is there a
  config read that returns ~0 data when it shouldn't?
