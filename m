For the background, I also had a lot of trouble understanding the
logic of how to usb_free_coherent() URBs when I wrote my own driver
(etas_es58x). At the end, I just mimicked what other USB CAN drivers
were doing which means that the etas_es58x was most certainly also
contaminated by that malady.

I really appreciate your effort to also want to fix others' drivers.

I hope so. Sometimes, there are some complicated intricacies which are
hard to appreciate (and I am not an expert of the USB subsystem). This
is why I CCed the USB mailing list. If I am wrong, someone should
eventually shout at me.

I sent you a patch. You can build on top of it the fixes for the other drivers.
And do not hesitate to resend it as part of your series (and in that
particular case, you would need to explicitly add the From: tag).


Yours sincerely,
