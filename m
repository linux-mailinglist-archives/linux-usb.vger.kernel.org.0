I did some prototyping, it seems a binding like this would work for
case a) or b):

&usb_1_dwc3 {
        hub_2_0: hub@1 {
                compatible = "usbbda,5411";
                reg = <1>;
	};

        hub_3_0: hub@2 {
                compatible = "usbbda,411";
                reg = <2>;
                vdd-supply = <&pp3300_hub>;
		companion-hubs = <&hub_2_0>;
        };
};

It still requires specifying both hubs (which reflects the actual wiring).
Supporting something like "reg = <1 2>" seems more complex due to the need to
obtain the hub USB device at runtime (a DT node makes that trivial), possibly
this could be solved by adding new APIs.

In terms of implementation would I envision to keep a platform driver. This
would keep the hubby parts out of xhci-plat (except for populating the platform
devices), support systems with cascaded hubs and provide a device for the sysfs
attribute.

The same binding could be used for a hub with I2C bus, however it would need
an additional I2C client node, unless we invent something new (case a). On
such a hub the "power down in suspend" feature would only work if the "USB
regulator" is not needed to preserve context of the I2C portion of the chip
during system suspend.
