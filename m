The preceding macros admittedly aren't consistent either :-P.  Here's
the whole section with my change:

	unsigned int            flags;
#define DWC3_EP_ENABLED		BIT(0)
#define DWC3_EP_STALL		BIT(1)
#define DWC3_EP_WEDGE		BIT(2)
#define DWC3_EP_TRANSFER_STARTED BIT(3)
#define DWC3_EP_END_TRANSFER_PENDING BIT(4)
#define DWC3_EP_PENDING_REQUEST	BIT(5)
#define DWC3_EP_DELAY_START	BIT(6)
#define DWC3_EP_WAIT_TRANSFER_COMPLETE	BIT(7)
#define DWC3_EP_IGNORE_NEXT_NOSTREAM	BIT(8)
#define DWC3_EP_FORCE_RESTART_STREAM	BIT(9)
#define DWC3_EP_FIRST_STREAM_PRIMED	BIT(10)
#define DWC3_EP_PENDING_CLEAR_STALL	BIT(11)
#define DWC3_EP_TXFIFO_RESIZED	BIT(12)

The macros for the earlier bits 0-2, 5 and 6 have shorter names and
therefore use one or two tabs to line up at an earlier tab stop.  But
the ones with the longer names for bits 7-11 use a single tab which bump
out the definition to the next tab column.  Since the macro I'm adding
in my patch has a shorter name I thought I'd follow the precedent of the
earlier bits and use a single tab which aligns with the earlier bits but
I agree it does look strange overall.  Especially with bits 3 & 4 which
aren't lined up at all.

I guess a patch to fix the rest of the earlier macros wouldn't hurt but
I'd also like this to go to stable too.  Should I send this as a 2-part
series: 1/2 being my change (with correct alignment and cc:stable) and
2/2 as a cleanup for bits 0-6?
