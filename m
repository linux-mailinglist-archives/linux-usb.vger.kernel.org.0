Hello
I try to describe more details about this overrun problem:
1) I tried only CP2102 because our company uses it, I have no idea whether 
the same apply for CP2104,2105... or not, I don't have another chip.
2) Maybe I should note I'm always using even parity (because of STM32 
bootloader protocol).
3) I thought the problem is created by unreaded data when closing because 
overrun was reported after closing if GET_COMM_STATUS shown positive 
ulAmountInInQueue before closing. Later I discovered that if I close the 
port, wait, send some data from outside, then open it, I will also get 
HW_OVERRUN flag.
4) So currently I suppose that problem is usually created by any incoming 
data after disabling interface. If I remove UART_DISABLE from close method, 
no overrun ever reported.
5) Unfortunately this overrun is not reported immediately after port 
opening but later after receiving first byte. I didn't find any way how to 
purge nor dummy read this flag before transmitting data.
6) I didn't find this problem in a chip errata and nobody complaining about it.
7) I successfully reproduced the same problem in MS Windows 10. If some 
data arrived to closed port, then I open it, everything is OK but after 
sending request and receiving reply I often get overrun indication from 
Win32 API ClearCommError()
8) I removed HW_OVERRUN checking because I don't want to break anything but 
maybe Linux driver should work the same way as Windows and don't hide this 
problem?
9) I needed just to detect parity error from user space and things 
complicate.Â  :-)

I suppose that GET_COMM_STATUS reads and CLEAR pending error flags (not 
explained in datasheet but behaves that way). So if some errors are 
reported during cp210x_tx_empty() it can be either counted immediately or 
lost. I'm not sure if cp210x_tx_empty() is called ONLY during close but 
seems be more consistent to count every detected error regardless who calls 
GET_COMM_STATUS.

I wasn't sure about port lock. I looked in several usb drivers (ftdi, 
pl2303) and it seems that port->icount.xxx increments are usually done out 
of lock. But if you wish I put increments into 
spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags), correct?
