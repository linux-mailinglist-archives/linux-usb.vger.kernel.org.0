Yes, these are I2C controlled hubs, which need hub specific drivers. This
driver is for hubs without an additional bus that share similar
initialization requirements and can benefit from common functionality.

This is the physical hub device on the platform bus, which is the
equivalent to this entry for a usb2512b hub on an I2C bus:

    usb2512b@2c {
        compatible = "microchip,usb2512b";
	reg = <0x2c>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio1 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
    };

(source: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/usb251xb.txt)

It doesn't have an I2C, SPI or other bus, hence the platform bus is
used.

It is the USB 2.0 part of the hub. The device is instantiated by
Linux even without this node, but the system associates the node
with the device, which suggests it 'exists'.

The usb2512b mentioned above implicitly also has a node here, it just
isn't specified since the USB controller autodetects it.

It is the USB 3.0 part of the hub.

The platform device isn't probed when the node is inside the USB
controller node. I haven't investigated why that's the case.

Yes, it is connected to two upstream ports. The platform driver needs a
reference to both/all hubs, to be able to determine whether to keep the
hub powered during system suspend or not.

Technically the hub with product id 0x5411 is connected to port 1 and the
one with product id 0x411 to port 2, so I would say the above is more
accurate than pretending one of the hubs is connected to both ports.

I would argue that the two hub nodes are similar to a SDIO BT/WiFi combo,
where you have one chip/module with multiple functions. The DT has entries
for both functions, even though they reside in the same chip and share the
same bus.
