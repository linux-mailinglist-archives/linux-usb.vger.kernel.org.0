This path series aims to add interconnect support in
dwc3-qcom driver on SDM845 and SC7180 SoCs.

Changes from v5 -> v6
  > [PATCH 1/4] Addressed comments from Rob.
  > [PATCH 2/4] Fixed review comments from Matthias in DWC3 driver.
  > [PATCH 3/4] Ignoring 80 char limit in defining interconnect paths.
  > Added [PATCH 4/4] in this series. Adding interconnect nodes for SC7180.
    Depends on patch https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11417989/.	

Changes from v4 -> v5
  > [PATCH 1/3] Added the interconnect properties in yaml. This patch depends
    on series https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11372641/.
  > [PATCH 2/3] Fixed review comments from Matthias in DWC3 driver.
  > [PATCH 3/3] Modified as per the new interconnect nodes in sdm845. Depends
    on series https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11372211/.
