Ok, but leaving the open flag abuse aside, that would still require a
custom tool to do the setup.

There are also no other examples of such an interface with a "sticky"
open flag affecting later opens. But you probably meant that the open
flag only affects the current open, and then the termios flag is used
to make the setting stick. 

Note that having a udev rule handle this at boot using a sysfs interface
does not require any custom tools at all.

And in theory nothing prevents extending/abusing POSIX with such an open
behaviour later.
