The the first 4 slots must be used by certificate authenticated with
USB-IF root CA. The last 4 slots can be used freely by usb device
vendors or system administrators. It will be the role of the userspace
policy engine to allow the configuration of the trusted root CAs and the
revocation lists.
We are currently on the mind that its out of scope of this kernel
patchset.

Currently, as far as we can see in the kernel code, trust for PCI
devices is solely based on whether they are placed on a external facing
PCI port marked as untrusted or not. It is similar to the concept of
internal devices for USB. But in both cases it does not involve any
cryptographic authentication of the device.

We however have been recently aware of the effort to port the SPDM
protocol for PCI in the kernel [1]. We think it could be a great
opportunitie to study if its possible to join our efforts. @Lukas,
@Alistair.

As said below, we think its best to left the complexity of the

We are not completely sure yet if the SPDM protocol is compatible with

NOK means Not OK. Authorized and authenticated represent the two
bitfields in the usb_device struct. They are reflected in the sysfs in
their respective files.

Sorry for that, we meant if the new `USB_AUTHENTICATION_ENFORCE` kernel

We are refering to the usb authorized_default mode that authorizes by
default internal devices only. The idea here is that, paired with
`USB_AUTHENTICATION_ENFORCE` we can more finely control the enforcement
point.

Sorry for that, we were refering to our current test device implemented

As far as we are aware, the last version of the specification [1] is the
last is the last version that includes errata from 2019. [3] is a
research paper that explored the limitation of the protocol. We are not
aware of any evolution since. We saw that SPDM reuses some of the USB
specification fields but we are not entirely sure yet if can be used in
place of the USB specification and if it fixes the limitations.

We think its up to the USB-IF to fix their specification and not up to

As we see it we could indeed do everything in the kernel but it will
mean that either every vendor certificates have to be loaded at compile
time as well as the security policy. Or we would need a way to load the
policy and certificates later through sysfs for example.

For the former it would be pretty unflexible. For the later as far as we
understand it there needs to be an userspace available and thus it is
possible to have an userspace policy engine.

We have not seen any slowdown, our concern is that the usb_device struct
pointer is no longer valid if for example the device has been ejected
during the authentication sequence. We still need to harden our current
implementation.

Since the second patchset, we have been working on the enforcement of
the two authenticated and authorized bitfields. The authenticated sysfs
file is exposed as read-only.

Not yet but we hope that having a host implementation will encourage the

It's feasible, for our current use we think it is easier to test with
qemu and virtme-ng. We currently use the testbed we published [7].

If it were to be implemented in a Linux gadget, it will raise the
question of a secure storage for the authentication key.
