It'd be nice if you summarized a little. Halfway between this and the first
revision of this patch. For example:

[...]

RX FIFO's size is calculated based on the following (in 4byte words):
 - 13 location for SETUP packets
 - 1 location for Global OUT NAK
 - 2 * 257 locations for status information and the received packet. Note t=
hat
   typically two spaces are recommended so that when the previous packet is
   being transferred to AHB, the USB can receive the subsequent packet.
 - etc...

Also, what is MC in your description? If in doubt just drop it a stick with=
 the
explanation above.

Regards,
Nicolas
