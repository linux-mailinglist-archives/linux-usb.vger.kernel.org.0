Yes, In normal mode EUD is bypassed.

This IP will be present in all qcom SoC's that is why this is specific 
to qcom, let us know if this is anyway problematic?

This has been addressed in patch set v3 which is pending for your review.

Will rephrasing above description as below would work?

"The link between event receiver and EUD is established via a directed 
graph. Where EUD act as output link and event receiver(ex. usb 
controller or charger h/w)Â  as input link"

patch set v3 has removed the part describing how graph binding works.

Can you please elaborate your query little more? USB controller has 
input connection from EUD as well as USB connectors.

As mentioned earlier, usb controller receive event from EUD only in 
debug mode while in normal mode USB connector supplies the event.

does that address concern?

As of now clients are usb controller and charger hardware, and they are 
fixed.

EUD application decide events dynamically.
