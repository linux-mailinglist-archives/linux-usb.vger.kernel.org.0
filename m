It isn't very common.  I think it was probably adopted as a stopgap kind 
of approach at a time when USB-3 was still relatively new and the 
chipsets didn't yet have full support for it.  On the other hand, it 
certainly isn't unheard of and it is compliant with the spec.

Of course, on any system that does this, the designers will be aware of 
it and could add the appropriate description (whatever it turns out to 
be) to DT.

This isn't really a difference in the hubs but rather in their support 
circuitry.  Still, if you look through the various *-platform.c files in 
drivers/usb/host (and also in pci-quirks.c), you'll see plenty of 
examples of platform-specific code for particular devices.

Ideally the new code would go into the hub driver.  But that won't work, 
since the hub driver doesn't get involved until the hub has been 
discovered on the USB bus, and that won't happen until its power has 
been enabled.

In theory the sysfs attribute could go under the host controller, but I 
agree it would be awkward.

This is just one example of a more general problem, as I mentioned in a 
recent email to Doug Anderson.
