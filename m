Ah, thanks for getting to the bottom of this.

I can imagine that we have a number of such issues.

Ok.

Thanks.

Which interrupt numbers are off by one here?

I took a quick look at the series, and it looks like this will
eventually clean things up a lot. We should probably define a generic
order for the interrupts with the sometimes optional SS interrupts last.

Side note: It looks like the threading in that series is broken.
Consider using git-send-email for sending series as it takes care of
things like that.
