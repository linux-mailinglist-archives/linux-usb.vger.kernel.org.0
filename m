What about people who _want_ BT to be a wakeup source?

Why does putting the device in reset save power?  That is, a suspended
device is very strictly limited in the amount of current it's allowed
to draw from the USB bus; why should it draw significantly less when it
is reset?

They are, but that doesn't mean you can't use them for other things 
too.

This series really seems like overkill for a single kind of device.

Is there any way to turn off the device's BT radio during suspend (if
wakeup is disabled) and then turn it back on during resume?  Wouldn't 
that accomplish what you want just as well?
