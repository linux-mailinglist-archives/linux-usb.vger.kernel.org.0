That device in UART mode was already supported by the serial driver. The 
original submitter just had to move a jumper on his board. There was no 
need to patch the kernel.

That product ID also supports UART but in a limited way, as only the RX and TX
pins are available. However it is the only one that supports i2c/spi/gpio, and
that's why I have to revert the patch. 

If that's desired, the new driver could add support for that as well, but I don't
think it's worth the effort.

It is possible if the device has an SPI flash connected to it, but none of
the cheap boards have that.

Frank.
