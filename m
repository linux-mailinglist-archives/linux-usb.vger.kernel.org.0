Notifiers were proposed for the USB role switches already some time
ago [1], and I don't think anybody was against them, but in the end I
don't think there were any users for those notifier, so they were
never added.

If something needs to only react to the role changes like I think in
this case, then I would just add those notifiers to the USB role
switches.

There was an idea to add bind and unbind callbacks to the software
nodes (callbacks that would be called when a device is bind to the
node) at one point in order to solve this kind of problems.

In this case it would work so that you would supply a software node
for the role switch in your glue driver (that part is not a problem),
and then if the bind of that software node is called, you know the
role switch was registered, and you can acquire the handle to it
safely and start listening notifications from it.

But I don't know if that's a very sophisticated solution.
