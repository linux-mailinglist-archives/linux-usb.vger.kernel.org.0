Yes,Â  It's necessary to add this reference.

I will change it in the next patch.

Bug description:

After indicating an Interrupt on Async Advance, the software uses the doorbell

mechanism to delete the Next Link queue head of the last executed queue head.

At this time, the host controller still references the removed queue head(the queue head is NULL).

NULL reference causes the host controller to lose the USB device.


Solution:
After deleting the Next Link queue head, the software can write one of the valid

queue head addresses to the ASYNCLISTADDR register to allow

the host controller to get the valid queue head.
