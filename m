What I found in the past is that things work. For example if the ehci
driver starts first, the USB device will come up as a 2.0 device and
when the XHCI driver comes up the device will switch to 3.0. I've see
the same thing happen if OHCI starts before EHCI. It's just that there
are some poorly behaved USB devices that have trouble with this.
