Hi Krzysztof,

Thanks a lot for your comments. Please see inline.

No, that is not true.

device_type->supports_removable=3D1 indicates that the bus / subsystem
is capable of differentiating between removable and fixed devices.
It's essentially describing a capability of the bus / subsystem. This
flag needs to be true for a subsystem for any it's devices'
dev->removable field to be considered meaningful.

OTOH, the dev->removable =3D> indicates the location of the device IF
device_type->supports location is true. Yes, it can be fixed /
removable / unknown (whatever the bus decides) if the
device_type->supports_location is true.

One of my primary considerations was also that the existing UAPI for
the USB's "removable" attribute shouldn't be changed. Currently, it
exists for all USB devices, so I think the current code / check is OK.

I think I made a mistake by using the "state" as the local variable
there. I will change it to "location". I'm happy to change the enums
above to DEVICE_LOCATION_REMOVABLE* etc if there is a wider consensus
on this. IMHO, the current shorter one also looks OK.

No, as I mentioned above, the dev->removable field should be
considered meaningful only if device_type->supports_location is true.
So the check for supports_removable is needed here.

Please feel free to send me more thoughts.

Thanks & Best Regards,
