It is even worse. Since we don't necessary need the EOF tag set but the
host will draw the content that it got after the FID has changed. It is
always possible that an frame that was errornous and therefor dropped
on the sendin side, will be shown on the host to the last macroblock it
received. So these partially drawn frames are more common then expected.

This totally makes sense. I just wanted to make sure that this does not
involve any UVC_STREAM_ERR tagging from your understanding.

I totally agree with this concept. So now we "only" have to implement
this. :)

First I will review and update my patches that will increase the amount
of requests per frame.
