Correct.

Drivers may expect devices to be runtime-active when their suspend
callbacks are invoked unless they set SMART_SUSPEND.  IOW, without
SMART_SUSPEND set the device should not be left in runtime suspend
during system-wide suspend at all unless direct-complete is applied
to it.

Correct.

It is correct, but in general the other way around is possible too.
That is, a suspend-side callback may be issued without the matching
resume-side one and the device's PM runtime status may be changed
if LEAVE_SUSPENDED is set and SMART_SUSPEND is unset.

The rationale here is that whoever decides whether or not to skip the
driver-level callbacks, should also set the PM-runtime status of the
device to match that decision.

It could, but sometimes that is not desirable.  Like when the drivver points its
suspend callback to pm_runtime_force_suspend().

I think so.

In the meantime I have created a git branch with changes to simplify the code,
rename some things and clarify the documentation a bit:

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm-sleep-core

(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git/log/?h=pm-sleep-core
for web access).

I'm going to post these changes as patches soon.

Cheers!
