If I understand correctly the original intention of this patch series is
to be able to differentiate whether the device is "permanently"
connected to the motherboard, or it is connected over some hot-pluggable
bus (PCIe, USB, USB4 for example but I'm sure there are other buses that
fit into this picture too). Specifically this is needed for discrete
GPUs because of power management differences or so (please correct me if
I'm mistaken).

If we set the is_thunderbolt debate aside and concentrate on that issue,
I think the way to do this is to check whether the root port the GPU is
connected to has an ACPI power resource (returned from _PR3() method).
IF it is present then most likely the platform has provided all the
necessary wiring to move the GPU into D3cold (and the BIOS knows this).
If it is not present then the device cannot even go into D3cold as there
is not means to power of the device in PCIe spec.

Perhaps we can simply use pci_pr3_present() here as nouveau is already
doing? Granted it is not too elegant solution either but better than
using is_thunderbolt IMHO. Since this seem to be common for many GPUs,
perhaps we can have a helper in DRM core that handles this.

Then going back to is_thunderbolt debate :) I really don't think the
drivers should care whether they are connected over a tunnel or not.
They should work regardless of the underlying transport of the native
protocol. They should also be prepared for the fact that the hardware
can vanish under them at any point (e.g user unplugs the device). For
this reason I don't really like to see is_thunderbolt to be used more
and prefer to get rid if it completely if possible at all. If there is
still need to differentiate whether the device can be hot-removed or
not, I think "removable" in the driver core is the way to go. That is
not dependent on any single transport.
