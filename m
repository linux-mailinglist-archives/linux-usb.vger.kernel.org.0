Hi Greg,

Apologies for the delay, please find the following comments as per my

This is fixing Commit:Â  a9e6f83c2df (usb: gadget: f_fs: stop sleeping in 
ffs_func_eps_disable)

Yes this fix is needed for >=5.4 Kernel releases.

> You are accessing epfiles outside of the lock.  How is that ok?
There are 2 parties that are trying to free the ffs->epfiles. We use the 
lock to serialize which party gets to free the ffs->epfiles. Where we 
are making it NULL we protected that, The freeing part doesn't need to 
be inside spinlock because now it is epfiles(local_ variable) with which 
we are trying to operate now. We removed the ffs->epfiles as the common 
structure to operate and made the local variable epfiles to do the job.

 From the above we already serialized the one who gets to free it. So 
whoever gets to access will mark it NULL so the other function trying to 
access ffs->epfiles backs off. I think reference count is not applicable 
here.

Yes this is for an existing race which we encountered.

This I Doubt because the reference count might not be decremented at 
anycase.
