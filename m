Can you post verbose ("lsusb -v") output for the three device types for
completeness?

Can you read back the state of the DTR pin when pulled low? So that you
can determine which UARTs have been disabled in hardware?

I'm leaning more towards not exporting this as a gpio device at all.
It's clear from the datasheet (and your implementation) that these pins
are supposed to be used with your own tranceivers. You can start with
only supporting RS232, and then we can discuss an interface for
switching modes later.

Ok, then I guess we must assume that the MODE pins are only connected to
your tranceivers and hardcoding the various configurations is fine.
