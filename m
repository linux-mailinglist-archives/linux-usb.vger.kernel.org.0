I agreed with your suggestion of using ' snps,cache-type =3D <foobar "cache=
able">, ...'

According to DWC3 data book, I think this (PCI) mean to the case of 'master=
 bus type =3D Native'
The data book describes this feature as 'system bus DMA option for the mast=
er bus,
which may be configured as AHB, AXI, or Native.' On Table 6-5, it says when=
 MBUS_TYPE
is Native, the definition of 4 transfer types control bits [3-0] is 'Same a=
s AXI'.

However, as to the code implementation to be generic to both PCI and AXI,
I admit I don't have a perfect solution so far, only 2 proposals with conce=
rns:

a. Create another module driver like dwc3-exynos.c (arch/arm/boot/dts/wxyno=
s54xx.dtsi)
    to contain above programming code. However, it will touch the same reg =
range of DWC3
    I think this is not good.

b. Add #ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_LAYERSCAPE in drivers/usb/dwc3/core.c to constrai=
n hacking code
   can only take effect for Layerscape (AXI case). I know it look ugly.

Do you have any better advice on this (besides changed power on default val=
ue from HW perspective)?

Several Layerscape platforms like LS1043ARDB, LS1046ARDB, etc. are already =
on
the market and have this issue. So I have to work out a SW patch to fix the=
