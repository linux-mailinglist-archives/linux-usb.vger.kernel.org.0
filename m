I would probably just say that it drops the initial reference created by
faux_device_create(), e.g.:

"Unregister a faux device and drop the initial reference obtained through
faux_device_create()."

--

From the formal side of things:

The thing with "can't touch the pointer you passed into here" is that it
depends on the conditions and on the definition of what it means for a pointer
to be valid.

Let's say I have another pointer (B) to the device with (of course) a separate
reference.

Now, when I call faux_device_destroy(A), and given that I know for sure that the
reference of (B) does out-live this operation, I could also argue that I
downgraded my strong reference to a weak reference.

So, technically I could still touch the pointer, but formally it probably
wouldn't be valid anymore.
