I agree, this doesn't look like a "quirk" in the sense of working
around a hardware defect; the handoff is just a normal part of
operating the device.  But can you elaborate on why it must be done
this way?

I'm looking at the xHCI r1.2 spec, sec 4.22.1.  It talks about the
handoff synchronization process and says the OS driver shall use the
defined protocol to request ownership before it uses the device.  But
AFAICT there's no specific "early-startup" requirement.

quirk_usb_handoff_xhci() is in drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c, which is
always built statically and the quirk runs during device enumeration,
even if the xhcd driver itself is a module.  It looks like we run the
quirk even if we never load the xhcd driver.

Why can't we just do the handoff in the xhcd driver probe?

So the answer is "to make Linux boot faster, flip this BIOS switch
which means your USB devices no longer work while in BIOS"?

I can see why this helps (BIOS never claims the xHCI, so OS can
immediately claim ownership), but it seems like a sub-optimal user
experience.
