Thanks for the dmesg log
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=283109).  It shows:

  acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: OS supports [ExtendedConfig ASPM ClockPM Segments MSI HPX-Type3]
  acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: platform does not support [SHPCHotplug LTR]
  acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: OS now controls [PCIeHotplug PME AER PCIeCapability]

I think it is incorrect for the platform to give the OS native control
over PME because the OS has no way to know how the RCiEP PMEs are
routed.  But it would be interesting to know how BIOSes on other
platforms with RCiEPs handle this, and I did post a question to the
PCI-SIG to see if there's any guidance there.
