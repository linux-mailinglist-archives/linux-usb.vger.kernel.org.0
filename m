The previous version of the dwc2 overlay set the RX FIFO size to
256 4-byte words. This is not enough for 1024 bytes of the largest
isochronous high speed packet allowed, because it doesn't take into
account extra space needed by dwc2.

Below is a detailed calculation which arises from dwc2 documentation:

* RAM for SETUP Packets: 4 * n + 6 locations in Scatter/Gather DMA mode
and 5 * n+8 locations in Slave and Buffer DMA mode must be reserved in
the RxFIFO to receive up to n SETUP packets on control endpoints, where n
is the number of control endpoints the device controller supports.

bcm283x: 5*n+8. The Broadcom core has 1 control EP (n=1), so 13 locations

* One location for Global OUT NAK

bcm283x: 1 location

* Status information is written to the FIFO along with each received
packet. Therefore, a minimum space of (Largest Packet Size / 4) + 1 must
be allotted to receive packets. If a high-bandwidth endpoint is enabled,
or multiple isochronous endpoints are enabled, then at least two (Largest
Packet Size / 4) + 1 spaces must be allotted to receive back-to-back
packets. Typically, two (Largest Packet Size / 4) + 1 spaces are
recommended so that when the previous packet is being transferred to AHB,
the USB can receive the subsequent packet. If AHB latency is high, you
must allocate enough space to receive multiple packets. This is critical
to prevent dropping of any isochronous packets.

bcm283x: (1024/4) +1 = 257 locations. For MC >1: 2 * 257 = 514 locations

* Along with last packet of each endpoint, transfer complete status
information is also pushed in to the FIFO.

bcm283x: The core should have 5 IN and 5 OUT EP's.
1 location for each EP - 10 locations.

It's for the case when all EPs are simultaneously completing transfers.

* An additional location for EPDisable status for each endpoint is
also required.

bcm283x: 1 location for each EP - 10 EP's - 10 locations
It's for case if EP simultaneously disabled.

* Typically, two locations for each OUT endpoint is recommended.

bcm283x: 5*2 = 10 locations

Total: 13 + 1 + 257 + 10 +10 + 10 = 301 locations

Safer is 301 + 257 (for MC>1) = 558 locations.
