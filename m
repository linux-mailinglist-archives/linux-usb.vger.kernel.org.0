After digging a bit further into the process of establishing a virtual
connection, I concluded rh_port_connect() cannot be used for the syscore
flag setup since the usb_device instance part of struct vhci_device
(vdev->udev here) is not yet initialized at that time.  That is because this
function is called right after the userspace tool responsible for initiating
a new USB/IP attachment writes the remote device information into sysfs -
see attach_store() in drivers/usb/usbip/vhci_sysfs.c.

The earliest execution context providing access to usb_device seems to be
during the enumeration process, which would explain why the vdev->udev
assignment has been done in vhci_urb_enqueue().  This should be normally
needed only when handling USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR, but for some reason
there's a reassignment in the USB_REQ_SET_ADDRESS handler as well.  I'd
assume it's possible that usb_device instance may change after
USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR, which is supposed to always precede
USB_REQ_SET_ADDRESS.

However, in all my tests done so far the operations where performed on the
same instance, hence I'm not sure if this is a real possibility or just a
leftover from downstream/experimental code base.

To remain on the safe side, I'll keep both calls to dev_pm_syscore_device(),
while adding in each case a comment on top with the relevant information.
