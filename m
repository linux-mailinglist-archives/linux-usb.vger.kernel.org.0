This sounds sort of like "my markup is good, yours is bad", honestly.  If
somebody were trying to add bracketed headings to a new document, I
suspect we'd get similar complaints.

The markup can certainly be toned down.  If you don't like |copy|, it can
just as easily remain "(c)" or become Â©, or just go away entirely.  That
would get rid of the ".. include:: <isonum.txt>" line too.  I would
happily make a rule that we don't bother with markup like |copy|
anywhere in the kernel docs.

The SPDX line is supposed to exist in all files, of course.

If Mauro does that, can you live with "::" to mark a literal block?  It
doesn't seem like a whole lot of noise...?

Thanks,

jon
