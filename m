Well, I meant automatically checking the validity with some tool, like a 
tool (code analyzer, model checker, ...) that can check if a certain 
annotation holds.

Maybe we have different understandings of a false positive reported by a 
tool...

My definitions are in the LPC 2020 presentation, Maintaining results from 
static analysis collaboratively, slide 4:
 
https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/7/contributions/700/attachments/606/1088/LPC2020-Static-Analysis.pdf

So, for me, what you wrote above is exactly the definition of a
"False Tool Finding (False Positive, Type A)".

Given that Alan will accept to add a comment in the code, it is a "True 
Tool-Induced Change (True Positive, Type B)" because we can actually 
provide a reasonable patch based on what the tool reported (even though it 
is just supportive documentation, no change in the code).

Well, given humans provide some annotations to initially false positives, 
there is a fair chance that a tool only gives true positives after the 
annotations.

With 'just comments', the tool will continue to complain and we will need 
to read the code once again every time we did not know that that case was 
a false positive. That going to happen often, namely every time, a new 
developer looks at the tool report.

Let us check if an annotation can help beyond the current comment. This 
annotation can of course be provided later independently with another 
patch.
