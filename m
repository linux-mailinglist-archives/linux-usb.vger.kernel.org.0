The kernel itself is generic and could work on all arm64 platforms. You 
have to however enable all ARCH_* because of the design choice:
1. device tree sources are toggled with ARCH_xxx
2. the given ARCH_xxx might select specific drivers needed for the 
kernel to work (or the drivers depend on it).

Maybe except the device trees, the case 2. above could be solved not 
with dependency but "imply".

Because x86 is plug and play? Has BIOS? You can have generic kernel? ARM 
is not like this - you need to load for example proper device tree blob 
matching your hardware. This could be loaded/passed/chosen by 
bootloader, but it's not the same as BIOS.

If you refer to only building, then options are usually 
compile-testable. But if you think about having a working kernel, why 
having a ARCH_xxx for given platform feels wrong? Isn't it nice to hide 
all stuff behind one option?

I think MIPS and RISC-V do similar.

 From the building point of view, I agree that the goal is to build them 
everywhere. This is why we have COMPILE_TEST. From the running/working 
point of view, these are not PCI or USB cards. These are dedicated 
blocks of System on Chip. They sometimes got reused on different SoCs 
but they do not exist outside the SoC.

Is there a point to split a complex PCI driver into 10 different parts 
and be able to use each of this part separately? Usually not...

Best regards,
Krzysztof
