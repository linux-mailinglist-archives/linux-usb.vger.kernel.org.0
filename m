I agree with Stephen that using device_is_bound() isn't a good option
in this case, when I suggested it I wasn't looking at the big picture
of how probing the core driver is triggered, sorry about that.

Reading the speed from the DT with usb_get_maximum_speed() as Stephen
suggests would be an option, the inconvenient is that we then
essentially require the property to be defined, while the core driver
gets a suitable value from hardware registers. Not sure if the wrapper
driver could read from the same registers.

One option could be to poll device_is_bound() for 100 ms (or so), with
sleeps between polls. It's not elegant but would probably work if we
don't find a better solution.
