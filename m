While your "output" and "input" matches the direction of the role
switching, I think the connection should be describe in the other
direction.

Also my suggestion was that EUD is both connector for the dwc3 and has a
reference to the connector described in the TypeC controller - to
properly describe the relationship:

  DWC -> EUD -> connector

With the role switching request going from the connector (pmic_glink
driver) to DWC through the EUD, which can override the vote.


That said, this is just my suggestion. You need to ensure that Rob
understands the hardware design well enough to approve your proposed
binding.


E.g. The connector in the EUD isn't a usb-c-connector, it's some
type of internal connection, the next step in that chain is the actual
usb-c-connector.
