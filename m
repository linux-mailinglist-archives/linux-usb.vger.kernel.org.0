Seems like I misremembered. Can't find the commit I was thinking
happened, and the only thing that changed was that aborts moved out of
the EH thread and be asynchronous.

Is that a limitation of the devices or drivers? Because then you don't
match SCSI semantics for LU reset - which aborts all running commands
on that scope among things. Which might explain the reason/choice behind
this unexpected behavior for you.

On random thought I had: in theory you could implement your own EH
strategy handler if the default one doesn't work for you. ATA and SAS do so.
[drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c:2285 `shost->transportt->eh_strategy_handler()`]
This can re-use parts/all of the existing escalation sequence in
`scsi_eh_ready_devs()`.

But that's no short-term fix.
