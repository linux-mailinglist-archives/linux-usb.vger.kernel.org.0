Yes, I think irrespective we should model this as a connector not an 
extcon and I think you could do think you could do that as a typec

1. Using role-switch
2. Use the regulator API to capture EUD related charger messages
    and trigger changes in the PMIC as opposed to using extcon
    to notify.

I could be wrong about #2

My understanding is we are generally being encouraged to model ports as 
connectors instead of extcon. I think it is possible to model your port 
driver as a typec connector using USB role-switching and the regulator 
API i.e. I don't think you really need extcon here.

In Debug mode will a DWC3 controller in host mode enumerate the internal 
hub ? If so, is that a supported use-case ?

So my thinking is

- DWC3 in host mode
   For argument sake, lets say an external self-powered hub is connected
   and a number of USB devices are enumerated
- EUD switches to Control Peripheral mode

In this case what would happen ?

If Debug mode is all you are trying to do support then I don't think you 
really need to model that in DT.

However if intend to support Control Peripheral mode which as I 
understand it, switches the UTMI signals away from a DWC3 controller in 
Host mode, then I think you would need to use a DT overlay to switch off 
the controller, before switching.

That's why I'm asking you about Control Peripheral mode - do you want to 
support it - and if so, then what happens to DWC3 in host mode when the 
UTMI signals go away ?

I think you've said you only want to support Debug mode, which makes 
more sense to me.

Is Debug mode only valid when the DWC3 controller is in 
peripheral/device mode and if so, should we be checking/enforcing that 
somewhere - DT or EUD-driver code ?

You have a routine to switch to debug mode that takes a parameter from 
user-space right ?

Bjorn mentioned you could write 42. My question/suggestion is why isn't 
the value written a string which corresponds to the supported modes from 
the EUD spec ?
"bypass" as default "debug" the mode you want to add, at a later time 
you could optionally add in "control-periperhal" mode.

Makes a little more sense to me than writing just 0, 1 or 42 :) into 
your store routine.
