Hello,

Yes, I'm aware that the event TRBs that follow a COMP_SHORT_PACKET 
should be COMP_SHORT_PACKET as well. That what I meant with "faulty 
event TRBs".

However I wasn't aware that these event TRBs were discarded on the basis 
that they didn't have a matching TD queued. Or more precisely, that the 
ep_seg would turn out NULL, and then it will turn out that !ep->skip && 
(xhci->quirks & XHCI_SPURIOUS_SUCCESS) will be true, as all recent xHCI 
controllers have XHCI_SPURIOUS_SUCCESS set.

So what I suggest is to move the XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH fix and warning to 
a place where it won't be reached if the event TRB is ignored anyhow. 
This makes the code slightly uglier, but it's a catch-all solution for 
all future Renesas (and similar?) chipsets.

Plus it does XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH some justice: I don't think it was 
meant as a way to silence warnings, but rather to handle controllers 
that submit a COMP_SUCCESS TRB with a non-zero length instead of a 
COMP_SHORT_PACKET.

I shall submit a patch with my suggested shortly after this mail. It 
silences the warnings on my machine (without the XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH 
you sent to me yesterday). Please take a look.

Thanks and regards,
    Eli
