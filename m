Hmm, PCIe r5.0, sec 2.3.1, says devices are permitted to return
Configuration Request Retry Status (CRS) after a "reset initiated in
response to a D3hot to D0uninitialized" transition.

I think that applies to this device because your lspci [1] shows:

	Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 3
		Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1- D2- AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0+,D1-,D2-,D3hot+,D3cold+)
		Status: D0 NoSoftRst- PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-

so No_Soft_Reset is clear, which means the D3hot to D0 transition goes
to D0uninitialized.

pci_raw_set_power_state() *does* delay, generally for 10ms:

  pci_write_config_word(dev, dev->pm_cap + PCI_PM_CTRL, pmcsr);
  if (state == PCI_D3hot || dev->current_state == PCI_D3hot)
    pci_dev_d3_sleep(dev);
  pci_read_config_word(dev, dev->pm_cap + PCI_PM_CTRL, &pmcsr);

but there's no mention of CRS, so I think that config read is liable
to fail with CRS if the device isn't ready, and we won't notice.

I think we need something like the patch below.  We already do
basically the same thing in pci_pm_reset().
