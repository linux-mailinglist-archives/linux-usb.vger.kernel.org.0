I'll double-check it using a second device. The RX path has largely
been unmodified since the original submission, so it's likely that the
issue is indeed with the TX path.

I set .bulk_out_size =3D 1024 in struct usb_serial_driver. Writing a 1k
buffer immediately results in:
   ch348 1-1:1.0: device disconnected

I don't know if I need to set some kind of flag on the URB to have it
split or whether the kernel / USB controller does that automatically
(as you can tell: I'm not familiar with USB).
If not: 512 byte transfers at a time it is.

I'll give it one more round in the next few days. If I can't get the
generic implementation to work then I'll call the current approach
good.

.
I think I made it work, sort of.
It's a bit annoying because of code I don't understand. It seems that
R_4 has the following settings:
0x00 DTR off
0x01 DTR on
0x10 RTS off
0x11 RTS on
0x08 activate (used during port initialization)
0x50 HW flow on
0x51 no RTS / HW flow off

That said, poking 0x00, 0x01, 0x10 and 0x11 by themselves didn't do much.
One also has to write 0x06 to the per-port VEN_R register.
The vendor driver only does that in .set_termios, which I call
questionable until someone calls me out on this and is willing to
share a good reason why that's a good idea ;-)

However, I'm unable to control the RTS line of port 1. It works for
port 0, port 2 and 3 but not for port 1.
Ports 4-7 don't have the TNOW/DTR and RTS lines routed outside the
package, so I can't test these.


Best regards,
Martin
