To me it looks like this creates an controller starting issue for
xHC hardware that have both usb2 and usb3 ports.

When we have usb3 ports xhci->shared_hcd is not set yet when xhci_run is called
the first time. We will end up starting the xHC before properly setting up the secondary hcd.

See further down for details

PCI xHC controllers with both usb2 and usb3 ports will be started before usb3 parts are properly set up.

xhci_pci_probe()
   usb_hcd_pci_probe()
     usb_add_hcd()
       hcd->driver->start(hcd)  // .start = xhci_run
         xhci_run()
           if (!xhci->shared_hcd)  // TRUE as xhci->shared_hcd is not yet set,
	    return xhci_run_finished(xhci)  // starting controller too early here
   xhci->shared_hcd = usb_create_shared_hcd()   // now xhci->shared_hcd is set.
