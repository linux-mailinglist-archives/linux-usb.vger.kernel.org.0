Most of it is in the IODA spec. See Sec 2.2.6 "Partitionable-Endpoint
State Table", the only part that isn't documented there is the top
bits of each word which are documented in the PHB spec for some
reason. For word one the top bit (PPCBIT(0)) means MMIO is frozen and
for word two (PPCBIT(64)) the top bit indicates DMA is frozen.

It might be only three lines, but it doesn't mean it's trivial. Most
bugs like that require a lot of context to understand, let alone fix.
Thanks for looking into it!
