Correction: The IOMMU grouping restriction solves the hardware issue for 
vfio-pci.  It won't necessarily help if some other driver comes along 
and wants to bind to this hardware.

Yes, that makes sense.  But it would have to be implemented in the 
driver core, not in particular subsystems like USB or PCI.  And it might 
be seen as overkill, given that only UHCI/OHCI/EHCI devices require this 
sort of sharing AFAIK.

Also, when you think about it, what form would such coordination among 
drivers take?  From your description, it sounds like the drivers would 
agree to avoid accessing each other's private data if the proper 
registration wasn't in place.

On the other hand, a stronger and perhaps more robust approach would be 
to enforce the condition that non-cooperating drivers are never bound to 
devices in the same group at the same time.  That's basically what I'm 
proposing here -- the question is whether the enforcement should be 
instituted in the kernel or should merely be part of a standard protocol 
followed by userspace drivers.

Given that it's currently needed in only one place, it seems reasonable 
to leave this as a "gentlemen's agreement" in userspace for the time 
being instead of adding it to the kernel.
