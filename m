Actually that's a fortunate outcome :)

Have you tried compiling FunctionFS with debugging enabled?
You do so bu uncommenting:

/* #define DEBUG */
/* #define VERBOSE_DEBUG */

at the beginning of drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_fs.c

Is there anything suspicious in the kernel log when you run it then?

Remote debugging through this mailing list will incur enormous
round trip time ;) The most valuable help would be helping in
reproducing the problem you encounter.

One question that comes to my mind is this: Does the USB transmission
stall (e.g. endpoint stall) or not? In other words, is adb connection
broken because USB stops transmitting anything, or because the
data is transmitted but its integrity is broken during transmission
and that causes adb/adbd confusion which results in stopping their
operation? Does anything keep happening on FunctionFS when adb
connection is broken?
