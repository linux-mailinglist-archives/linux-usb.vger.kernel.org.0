Why must it be visible to userspace?  How have we passed testing before
now?

But there is no user for this new user/kernel api anywhere.  Android
does not do this today, what is the chance it really will use it?  Do
you have working patches somewhere that will land if this is added?

And where is any of this being documented? :)

Great, but again, why not make it generic so that all can use it?

Otherwise we end up with a USB-specific solution that no one else can
ever use in the future.
