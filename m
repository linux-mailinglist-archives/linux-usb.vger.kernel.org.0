Yes, that's a good point.  Go ahead and make this change.  And be sure 
to put a blank line before the new comment line.

I also think the patch description should be rewritten.  It talks
about things that are not relevant to the patch.  For example, you
don't _know_ that your host controller is sending SOF packets in the
non-UsbOperational state; you only know that it is generating
interrupts with the INTR_SF flag set.

So you should change the description to something like this:


While going into S3 or S4 suspend, an OHCI host controller can
generate interrupt requests if the INTR_SF enable flag is set.  The
interrupt handler routine isn't prepared for this and it doesn't turn
off the flag, causing an interrupt storm.

To fix this problem, make ohci_rh_suspend() always disable INTR_SF
interrupts after processing the done list and the ED unlinks but
before the controller goes into the suspended (non-UsbOperational)
state.  There's no reason to leave the flag enabled, since a suspended
controller doesn't generate Start-of-Frame packets.
