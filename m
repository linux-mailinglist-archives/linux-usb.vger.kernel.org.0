Hi Ferry,

Thanks for the testing.  Just to double check, did you also enable the
property, which enabled the TXFIFO resize feature on the platform?  For
example, for the QCOM SM8150 platform, we're adding the following to our
device tree node:

tx-fifo-resize

If not, then your results at least confirms that w/o the property
present, the changes won't break anything :).  Thanks again for the
initial testing!

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
