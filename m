Thanks for the confirmation. Good to know about device_pm_wait_for_dev(),
even if we are not going to use it in this case.

I think the only concern would be a scenario where the USB devices are
unbound and rebound over and over again, which would result in a
struct udev_node being kept around for every bind until the platform
device is removed. It seems unlikely and shouldn't be a big problem
as long as the number of bind/unbind cycles is in the thousands rather
than millions.
