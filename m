Our verification framework report numerous issues like the one for which 
I sent the given patch. There are many warnings for different USB 
drivers and other types of device drivers as well. We sent several 
patches that were acknowledged by the developers already, though, after 
the Andrew's reply [1] I have doubts that we need to treat these 
warnings as potential bugs and fix them. The verification framework 
performs static analysis in a way that I described before [2]. Regarding 
the clock API it uses such models of clk_prepare() and clk_enable() that 
can fail independently on underlying hardware since is not easy to 
either model all such hardware or try to relate and consider 
corresponding drivers in addition to drivers using clocks at 
verification. Thus, potentially the verification framework can produce 
warnings for all drivers that invoke clk_prepare(), clk_enable() or 
clk_prepare_enable(), but do not check for their return values.

I look forward whether you will confirm that it makes sense to handle 
errors from mentioned functions anyway or it would be better not to sent 
such bug reports unless we will be strictly sure that they can happen. 
In the former case it would be better if somebody will teach built-in 
Linux kernel static analyzers to detect these issues on a regular basis.
