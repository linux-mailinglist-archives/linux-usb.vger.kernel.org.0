As you use Gentoo and are able to build your own Linux kernel, the 
fastest way to get these issues addressed is to bisect them. To shorten 
the test cycles, I recommend to try, if you can reproduce the issues in 
QEMU and passing through the problematic devices to the VM [1][2].

I also recommend to start a separate thread for each issue and, as these 
seem to be regressions, also keep the regression folks in the loop [3].


Kind regards,

Paul

      (The commands were working for after all, and the device didn’t 
show up due to a (second) Linux kernel regression.)
