OK, that would need a little tweaking.  Also, we should only need this
for the D3hot->D0 transition and probably only when No_Soft_Reset is
clear.  We shouldn't need it for the D0->D3hot transition, since
that's not a reset.

That's really strange.  Your original message showed:

  xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.4: Refused to change power state, currently in D3
  xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.4: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)

The first line is from pci_raw_set_power_state() reading PCI_PM_CTRL,
but we can't tell whether the read failed and we got ~0, or it
succeeded and we got something with just the low two bits set.  Can
you print out the whole value so we can see what happened?

The second line is from pci_enable_resources() reading PCI_COMMAND,
and it got *0*, not 0x0403 as you got from the CRS experiment.
