Interesting. Is this ABI going to need to be defined explicitly, or is the plan
to just mimic the PD protocol messages as much as possible?

I'm assuming the PDOs themselves will still need to be stored in the connector
class port/partner data structures, right?

Sounds good. I look forward to trying out your series when it's ready.
