Strictly speaking, the peering relation applies to ports, not
devices.  The representation in DT doesn't have to be symmetrical; as
long as the kernel understands it, the kernel can set up its own
internal symmetrical respresentation.

Well, I guess I'm okay with either approach.

One more thing to keep in mind, though: With the platform device,
there should be symlinks from the hubs' sysfs directories to the
platform device (and possibly symlinks going the other way as well).
