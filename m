Why would anybody do that?  Who would deliberately go change a driver in 
a way that is obviously wrong and would break it?  Especially when such 
changes are likely to cause compile errors?

There are tons of changes one might make to any program that will leave 
it syntactically valid but will cause it to fail.  What's special about 
removing the early calls to find_tt()?

That really seems unnecessary.

Real code contains so many assumptions, especially if you include ones 
which are obvious to everybody, that such a tool seems impractical.
