Depending on the application it may be acceptable to assert the
modem-control lines on first open (e.g. before initialisation). 

A new termios flag allows for a generic interface which could be shared
with other OSes and controlled through stty.

In case that isn't sufficient and you need control over the default port
setting, you can always fall back to the Linux-specific sysfs interface.

Let's see, but I don't think this necessarily has to take that long to
get merged.
