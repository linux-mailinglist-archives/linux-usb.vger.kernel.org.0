Perfect, thanks for confirming.

Thanks for checking.

Right, so it seems we have two issues here:

First, the disabled rx timer, which we can fix.

And second, the lost character after updating LCR, which we may be able
to work around, for example, by disabling LCR control for older devices
(i.e. pre-4.10 behaviour) or by not updating LCR unless the settings
have changed (but that would still likely cause a lost character when we
do). A third option may be to experiment with using the INIT command to
set the line-speed and LCR, but that also has some side-effects like
toggling the modem-control lines on termios changes, which I wanted to
avoid.

And we still need to set LCR on probe, which may trigger the lost
character unless we do this using the INIT command and that turns out
to work.

Can you try the below patch and see if that still triggers the lost
character after probe and line settings changes? Please also try to
confirm that LCR can be updated this way at all.

Note that using INIT like this seems to trigger a similar issue with my
CH341A.

Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: ch341: fix disabled rx timer on older devices

At least one older CH341 appears to have the RX timer enable bit
inverted so that setting it disables the RX timer and prevents the FIFO
from emptying until it is full.

Only set the RX timer enable bit for devices with version newer than
0x27.

Also try using the INIT command to update LCR to work around a separate
issue with lost characters after LCR updates on older devices. Note that
using INIT like this triggers a similar problem on newer CH341A.
