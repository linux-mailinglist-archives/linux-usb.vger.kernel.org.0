Apologies, I think I might have expressed myself poorly, being a kernel noob
;-). I know that this is a stylistic change rather than a functional
one -- I meant that I was hoping that it would be helpful to get rid of bad
uses of snprintf().

I really like your idea of helper methods though :-). If in show()
methods we could have something like:
	return sysfs_itoa(buf, i);
in place of:
	return sprintf(buf, "%d\n", i);

... then we wouldn't be introducing any new calls to sprintf() as you
say, but we'd still be removing a call to snprintf() (which also may be
problematic). Plus we'd have type checking on the argument.

For returning strings, we could have a bounded and unbounded variant of
the function. As it seems like only single values should be returned via
sysfs, if we did things this way then it would only be these
string-returning functions which could cause buffer overflow problems
and kernel devs could focus their attention accordingly...

What do people think? I'm happy to have a crack, provided this is
actually a sensible thing to do! I'm looking for a newbie-level project
to get started with.

Thanks for the feedback all,
Alex
