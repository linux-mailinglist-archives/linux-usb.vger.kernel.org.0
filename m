This path series aims to add interconnect support in
dwc3-qcom driver on SDM845 and SC7180 SoCs.

Changes from v8 -> v9
  > Addressed comments from Matthias.

Changes from v7 -> v8
  > Only driver change is pending all other patches are merged so dropped
    from the series.
  > Removed the device_is_bound call and getting speed from device tree
    and rearranged interconnect functions to avoid forward declarations.	
  > Added patch to specify maximum speed for dwc3 DT node.

Changes from v6 -> v7
  > [PATCH 2/4] Fixed review comments from Matthias in DWC3 driver.
  > Other patches remain unchanged.

Changes from v5 -> v6
  > [PATCH 1/4] Addressed comments from Rob.
  > [PATCH 2/4] Fixed review comments from Matthias in DWC3 driver.
  > [PATCH 3/4] Ignoring 80 char limit in defining interconnect paths.
  > Added [PATCH 4/4] in this series. Adding interconnect nodes for SC7180.
    Depends on patch https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11417989/.	

Changes from v4 -> v5
  > [PATCH 1/3] Added the interconnect properties in yaml. This patch depends
    on series https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11372641/.
  > [PATCH 2/3] Fixed review comments from Matthias in DWC3 driver.
  > [PATCH 3/3] Modified as per the new interconnect nodes in sdm845. Depends
    on series https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11372211/. 


Changes from v3 -> v4
  > Fixed review comments from Matthias
  > [PATCH 1/3] and [PATCH 3/3] remains unchanged

Changes from v2 -> v3
  > Fixed review comments from Matthias and Manu
  > changed the functions prefix from usb_* to dwc3_qcom_*

Changes since V1:
  > Comments by Georgi Djakov on "[PATCH 2/3]" addressed
  > [PATCH 1/3] and [PATCH 3/3] remains unchanged
