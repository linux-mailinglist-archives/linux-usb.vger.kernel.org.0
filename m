Going back here a bit... It now looks like this second part is not
possible, which sucks, but it only means registering a separate object
(psy) for each PDO is even more important.

If we can leave the decision about the selection to TCPM, that would
be great! I'm not against that at all. As I said, I have not though
through the control aspect. Right now I'm mostly concerned about how
we expose the information to the user. The only reason why I have
considered the control part at all is because how ever we decide to
expose the information to the user, it has to work with control as
well.

If there is anything that should be improved in the PSY class itself
(and I'm sure there's plenty), then we improve it.

The final PSYs and the supply chains they create as well as the
individual properties I'm more than happy to talk about, but having a
separate object for the smallest thing that we can see (PDO) is the
right thing to do here IMO. Trying to concatenate things into single
objects especially in sysfs, despite how nice it always would seem,
has taken me to the brink of disaster in the past far too many times.

In this case we don't need to take the risk of having to duplicated
information or in worst case deprecate something that is also exposed
to the sysfs in the future.

So the question is not why should we registers every individual PDO
separately. The question is, why shouldn't we do that? And saying that
it's "heavyweight" I'm afraid is not good enough. :-)

Right now I simply don't see any other way that would be as flexible,
or that could even handle all the different platforms in uniform way
(this needs to work with TCPM, UCSI, and everything else), as
registering separate object (psy) for every single PDO.
