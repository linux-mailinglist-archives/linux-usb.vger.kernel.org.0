That sounds very strange.  Suppose one of the ports is suspended, so access to the 
OHCI registers is blocked.  Then how can you resume the port?  Don't you have to 
access the OHCI registers in order to tell the controller to do the port resume?

What happens when there's more than one port, and one of them is suspended while 
the other one is still running?  How can you communicate with the active port if 
access to the OHCI registers is blocked?
