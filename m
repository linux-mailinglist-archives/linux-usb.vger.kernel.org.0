It's still a big no from me for this one as it is, sorry. You are
trying to achieve too many things with these files.

The first thing here is that you want to offer the user a way to
define the order in which the modes are entered, and that's actually
something that we do *not* have any support for at the moment. I'm not
against this part. As long as you justify the need for this, and
ideally offer a way to setup the priorities also in tcpm.c, I'm okay
with it. But you do need to justify the need for this IMO. The specs
actually dictate the order in which these modes should be entered does
it not

But the second part is that you want to also use this file to disable
the modes. For that we do have the mechanisms already in place, so
there is no point in trying to include that here. It does not even
sound like the primary goal for you - your main goal is to just be
able to define the order, right?

So this is my suggestion: Change this so that you can only supply the
preferred order for the modes - the priorities. Get rid of the numeric
values - by simply listing the modes in the file becomes more machine
readable while still being perfectly human readable.

And the name. I agree that USB4 should be an alt mode, but it's not.
This should really be a no-brainer. Just s/altmode/mode/. That way
the naming is aligned with what you are proposing in patch 5/6.

My two cents - I'm sure this is clear to most of you, but not to
everybody.

The problem with the USB Type-C framework that I wrote is that it was
primary designed to support tcpm.c, but unfortunately it does not work
very well with the PD controllers when it comes to the alternate modes.

With tcpm.c we need to handle the alternate mode communication inside
kernel, but with PD controller we of course can't do that. The altmode
bus and altmode drivers are not needed with PD controllers, in fact
they only complicate things with the PD controllers.

So there are basically two separate ways of handling the same thing.
That's why I think we may need something like these files that you
guys are suggesting. We need a way to support the controlling of
alternate modes with PD controllers, or perhaps I should say
with interfaces that support it.

But that said, this series is not acceptable as it is quite yet. You
are trying to push a lot of information and control to these couple of
files which I'm not convinced is always necessary, and possibly even
prone to errors. I'm also really concerned that you want to only deal
with a predefined list of modes. It will probable not be a problem as
long as we can fallback to ABI that we already have. But during my
short career I've already seen several cases where assumptions have
been made about how a specific technology will be used, and it has in
practice always backfired.

thanks,
