In that case, shouldn't Rajat's patch change go into the driver core 
rather than the hub driver?  _Every_ device downstream from a 
removable link should count as removable, yes?  Not just the USB 
devices.

And to say that the attribute is supported only by USB and PCI is 
misleading, since it applies to every device downstream from a 
removable link.

I don't know if we need it, but such an attribute seems like a good 
idea.
