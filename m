That is where you would set the flag.  You might want to put the 
register definition in ehci_def.h, with the other definitions.

Yes, it would have to go into the device tree data somehow.  I don't 
know the best way to do this; people who know more about DT may be able 
to tell you.

Yes, this is the right approach.
