Looks "interesting", nice work!

I stopped at patch "Add initial support for USB4" as I don't think we
want to add USB4 code to a system that we know does not have it, right?

Everything up to then is just "normal" thunderbolt, and with the
exception of a few minor comments, all look fine to me.

I didn't actually read the USB4 patch just yet, as I figured we needed
to argue about that some more :)
