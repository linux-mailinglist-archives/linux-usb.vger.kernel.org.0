I have not.

I only use this chip to detect charger type (and cable polarity), the 
device where this is integrated is always peripheral and cannot charge 
other devices or become host.

But I think those aforementioned requirements could be extended on top 
of this patch, can they not ? I recall I looked at least at the 
direction detection and that could be added easily. I have no way of 
testing any of that functionality, so I didn't add them as part of the 
patch.
