I'm not saying no to the "raw" proposal. I would prefer that we parse
the data for the userspace in this case, but if you guys think that it
is better to just let the userspace take care of that, then I'm fine
with that too.

I'll take a look at this. I can prepare something. Let's start with
the raw dump approach.
