For now this quirk does solve the issues regarding the pluging
behaviour. But we would like to know why?

Is the phy not properly configured/connected to serve the phy
suspend as intended for the dwc3 stack? Is this a real Hardware issue,
or does this quirk only disable the suspend behaviour even though it
would work properly when configured correctly in software.


The second question is addressing the dwc3 xilinx glue driver
you are trying to mainline. We found that the driver is pulling and
releasing some resets before and after changing the pll frequency
comming from the reference clk lines. After that the undocumented
registers XLNX_USB_FPD_POWER_PRSNT and XLNX_USB_FPD_PIPE_CLK are changed
according to the updated pll frequency. What do these bit change?
Is this an internal configuration every dwc3 user on the zynqmp has
to do or does this differ from user to user?

Regards,
Michael
