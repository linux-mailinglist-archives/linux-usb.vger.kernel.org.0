With "git log -S of_overlay_ drivers/", I found the prior cases. See
841281fe52a7 ("drm: rcar-du: Drop LVDS device tree backward
compatibility") and 739acd85ffdb ("drm/tilcdc: Remove obsolete
"ti,tilcdc,slave" dts binding support")

I would consider putting them in drivers/of/ as well. Then we could
better control the order of applying the overlay and creating devices.
It avoids a lot of the complexity if the overlay is applied first.

You'd just make platform_get_resource() call of_address_to_resource()
internally if there's a node pointer. There could be drivers that
break and it would be slower if we defer probe since it would parse
the DT every probe. But really, an overlay applied earlier is a better
approach IMO.
