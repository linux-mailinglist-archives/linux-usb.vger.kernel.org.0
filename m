Ok, a char device sounds fine, but _what_ userspace code is going to be
using this interface?  We need to have a working version of that as well
before we could take this new interface, otherwise it wouldn't make much
sense.

And why does userspace have to do this, what is wrong with the kernel
doing it as it does today?  I.e. what is broken that adding a new api to
the kernel is going to fix?

That needs to be documented really really well.
