Sorry for the late response.  I was trying to get a reliable change to
get the issue to reproduce.  I think I was able to find a set up which
will generate the unexpected direction issue.  I'll try my best to
summarize the traces here:

Set up:
- Modified XHCI stack to queue an IN TRB for a three stage CONTROL OUT
transaction (OUT data stage)
- Device is using RNDIS, as that has interface specific commands (ie
SEND_ENCAPSUALTED messages)

Kernel Log:

So the kernel log does indeed show the concern mentioned by Thinh, where
after ending the transfer, we do see the dwc3_ep0_out_start() fail due
to no xfer resource.
