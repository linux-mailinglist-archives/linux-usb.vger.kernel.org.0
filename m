I fail to see how the documentation could be interpreted that way. As you
explained, "rgmii" actually means that the delay is added by the PCB, so th=
ere
simply is no "when required" here - it can't be required if it's already in=
 the
PCB. I stand by my opinion that this doc is plain wrong and not just worded
poorly, and needs to be fixed to express the intended meaning.

(I believe we agree on the point that this should be improved, I just don't
think it is appropriate to make statements like "few developers actually
understand RGMII delays" when the inaccuracy of the binding docs - supposed=
ly an
authoritative resource on the meaning of DT properties - is the cause of th=
e
misunderstanding)

I don't know about Aspeed (maybe you're mixing something up, or I'm not awa=
re of
something?) - in the case of the TI driver I'm dealing with, this is indeed
possible to fix up because the MAC always adds a delay, it is not configura=
ble.

The whole point of my suggestions is to allow fixing the drivers while stay=
ing
compatible with old, broken Device Trees. If we could add a property 'phy-m=
ode-
is-fubar' to old Device Trees, we could just fix them instead - but we can =
only
fix in-tree DTS, and it will only have an effect on systems that update the=
ir
DTBs with their kernel, so I believe this simply isn't an option because of
backwards compat guarantees for Device Trees.

Ah, I like that idea - I'll see if I can find time to look into it.

Best,
