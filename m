As I said this patch doesn't fix the issue with hotplug. With this patch =
=0A=
or without the hotplug behaves as it was. I have tested it on our setup.=0A=
=0A=
Have you debugged your patch? Does it make any difference on your setup =0A=
? Does it fix the issue with hotplug?=0A=
=0A=
Try to debug with the following steps.=0A=
1. Debug code with just your patch. Capture the logs and provide. So =0A=
that I can see what is difference with your patch.=0A=
2. Debug only with my series and see if those issues with hotplug are =0A=
still there.=0A=

Have you tried to debug dwc2 with power_down =3D=3D DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_N=
ONE ?=0A=

Currently (without your and my patches) (looking at mainline Linux) the =0A=
function dwc2_port_suspend() is called anyway because its call is issued =
=0A=
by the system. But it performs entering to suspend only in case of =0A=
DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_PARTIAL.=0A=
=0A=
This is not an assumption. What I am pointing out is based on debugging =0A=
and before making assumptions without debugging for me seems not ok.=0A=
=0A=
Currently without your patch and without my patches. In the =0A=
dwc2_port_suspend() it will enter to suspend only in case that =0A=
power_down =3D=3D DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_PARTIAL. Because if you look at the=
 =0A=
code more carefully you will see=0A=
=0A=
  	if (hsotg->params.power_down !=3D DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_PARTIAL)=0A=
		goto skip_power_saving;=0A=
=0A=
This says if power_down is not DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_PARTIAL then skip =0A=
power saving.=0A=
=0A=
So but after your patch. If power_down is DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE it =0A=
tries to suspend.=0A=

It currently (without my and your patches) doesn't set PCGCTL_STOPPCLK =0A=
when power down is DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE. Because again and again =0A=
when power down is DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE power saving is skipped.=0A=

No if your patch is doing the same thing as it was doing before what is =0A=
the purpose of the patch ?=0A=

My testes show that your patch doesn't fix the issue related partial =0A=
