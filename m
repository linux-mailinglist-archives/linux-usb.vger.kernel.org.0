I see the very first patch of this series has already been merged in 
somewhere between v5.12-rc3 and v5.12-rc2. See commit 1cffb1c66499 ("usb: 
dwc3: qcom: Add missing DWC3 OF node refcount decrement"). But the rest of
the patches still hanging up unattended. I'll resend them in a few minutes.
Could you merge them in too?

-Sergey
