I understand that.

As mentioned in the other message, I attempted to allow
pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume() to be used along with setting SMART_SUSPEND,
but that looks like a mistake now.

I agree that skipping the driver-level callbacks regardless of what is provided
by the subsystem would be more consistent.

Basically, all devices with SMART_SUSPEND set whose late/noirq suspend callbacks
were skipped can be left in suspend during system-wide resume by skipping their
callbacks, so that they can be resumed by PM-runtime (that becomes kind of like
direct-complete at that point), but some drivers may not want that for earlier
device response after system-wide resume (if it is resumed by the system-wide
code, it will be immediately ready when user space is unfrozen).

It is expected that LEAVE_SUSPENDED will be used along with SMART_SUSPEND unless
the above is the case.

And there are platforms where the firmware turns off everything (except for
wakeup devices) at the end of system-wide suspend too.

There really isn't that much of a difference in general.

Yes, I thought 0 and wrote 1, sorry.

I misread what you wrote, so agreed.

No, I don't think so.
