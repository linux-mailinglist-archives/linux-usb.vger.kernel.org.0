This is not a good description of a device property.  DT entries are 
supposed to described the hardware, not talk about how to use it.

When you say that the bcm63xx doesn't support over-current reporting, 
what exactly do you mean?  Do you mean that sometimes the hardware turns 
on the over-current bit when an over-current isn't actually present?  Or 
do you mean something else?
