Small update,

Following initial work from Maud, I hacked around a bit and got HDMI
working _most of the times_ on cold boot. Far from complete, but this
proves the IC is indeed working as dumb bridge. At least non Zenbook
DP routed to qmphy, like hinted by DSDT.
I am guessing the HPD event comes too early, before AUX is ready for
EDID readout to be the cause of the hotplug almost never working,
since I can always readout EDID manually just fine. Will need to
investigate it a bit more.

Initial (dirty) change for Asus Zenbook A14 [1].
