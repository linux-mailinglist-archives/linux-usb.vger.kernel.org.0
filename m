Thanks; I tried this by returning USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS from the 
function's .setup() callback and later (after userspace checks the data 
packet) either calling usb_ep_queue() or usb_ep_set_halt() and it does 
seem to be working. This surprises me, as my understanding was that the 
purpose of USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUSÂ  is to pause all control transfers 
including the data phase to give the function driver enough time to 
queue a request (and possibly only for specific requests). Regardless 
though I think the conclusion from previous discussions on this topic 
(see [1] for example) was that we don't want to rely on 
USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS to do this which is why I had avoided it in 
the first place. A colleague made a series [2] some time ago that adds a 
flag to usb_request which function drivers can set when queuing the data 
phase request. UDC drivers then read that flag to decide whether to 
delay the status phase until after another usb_ep_queue(), and that's 
what I'm trying to implement here.
