Don't need a type here. You can assume common properties have a type 
defined already. Note that the $ref would have to be under an 'allOf' or 
else const is ignored. But this sillyness in json-schema changes in 
draft8, so soon you can forget what I just said.

Indeed. Not really any way to handle this, so it's just for 
documentation. I would put a description for each entry.

Pretty generic. Just drop the description.

Needs to define how many and what each one is:

items:
  - description: ...
  - description: ...

Already has a type, don't need.

Yes, a per item description.

This won't compile. Use 'make dt_binding_check'.
