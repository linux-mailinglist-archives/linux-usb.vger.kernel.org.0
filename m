My point is, this needs to be documented!!!

Right now it just looks like you made up a magic number here.  Look at
the other defaults in this function right above this line.  Those
comments explain what is happening, unlike your change.

Do you want to look at this code in 3 years and wonder why this number
was picked?

That's fine, but is that what is really happening here?  You are not
looking at the "do_fifo_resize" value before you try to read the "max"
value, why not?

Where is that documented or happening?
