I tried to reproduce your usb-conn-gpio message on my machine but I failed.
Probably because my USB port does not have ID pin...

Currently OpenWrt does not enable CONFIG_POWER_RESET_MT6323 so I was not aware of the poweroff error.
After I enabled it I got the same error and I could not resolve it... I'd better disable it for now.

Do you mean that vbus turns on but your usb stick is not detected?
Does that change if you use `dr_mode = "host"`?

Do you mean vbus subnode in musb or vusb subnode in pmic?
I've never used vusb node, it did not affect me in any way.
When I used usb_vbus regulator node to enable vbus line, it did not turn on the line unless I added `regulator-always-on`...
It seems the connector node is not really required for me.

I don't really know how it does work, but for me it does turn on vbus in host mode and turn it off in device mode.
I imagined DRV_VBUS setup will make the musb controller itself (and not kernel) control the line as needed, but it's just my guess.
