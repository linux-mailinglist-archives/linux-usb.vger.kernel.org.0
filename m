Why do you think so?

That's what happens with your patch.  Now look at what happens without 
the patch:

1. USB disconnected
2. UDC unbound
3. DWC3 suspend request is added to waitqueue
4. UDC bound unexpectedly
5. DWC3 suspend request is removed from waitqueue
6. DWC3 runtime idle
7. DWC3 runtime suspend

The difference is that this way, we avoid doing an unnecessary suspend 
and resume, and we save the time they would have required.

Why do you think we should guarantee this?
