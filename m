Subject: [PATCH v5 0/2] usb: typec: tps6598x: Export some power supply properties

This allows downstream supplies and userspace to detect whether external power
is supplied.

The Librem 5 has the tp65982 in front of bq25980 charge controller.  Since that
is capable of sinking and sourcing power the online property helps to decide
what to do. It also makes upower happy.

There will be follow up patches providing more properties but these need some
more time to cook and i wanted to check if this is the right way to go?

    - Flip USB_ROLE_SWITCH and REGMAP_I2C from 'depends on' to 'select'
      This matches tcpm and avoids a config symbol recursion which went
      unnoticed on my arm64 build but trips up x86_64.
