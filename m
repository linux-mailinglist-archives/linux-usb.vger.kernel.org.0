no they don't. The glue is a real piece of HW that adapts the "generic"
synopsys IP to a given SoC. OMAP, for example, was adapting Synopsys'
proprietary interface to the Sonics interconnect, while some others may
adapt it to AXI or PCI or whatever.

They are different HW blocks, the glue (in many cases) has its own IRQ,
its own address space, its own register file, and so on. Granted, the
glue also serves as an access port from CPU to the synopsys core, but
that's handled by `ranges' DT property.
