The result goes into ctx->buf which is big enough. Then each edid block
is copied from that buffer as the parser runs the callback.

Maybe I should add a cap on ->edid_len, but I don't know how big it
should be. There's no danger as such not having a cap, the host will
either fail to allocate memory (max 4MB usually) or do a very big
transfer and error out in the edid parser.

If gud_connector_status_req.status has changed since last poll or
GUD_CONNECTOR_STATUS_CHANGED is set, DRM will notify userspace which
will reprobe the connector. connector->epoch_counter++ in
gud_connector_status_request() triggers that.

I see what you mean, I'll give it a try.

It's not allowed to return an error code so 0 is the only option. The
caller drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes() adds a fallback
1024x768 mode in that case which probably won't fit for a display panel,
but the device should reject an illegal mode on GUD_REQ_SET_STATE_CHECK
so we're fine.

It's freed in gud_connector_destroy() which will be called on error at
this stage.

Everything that happens after the drm_connector_init() call is cleaned
up automatically when the DRM device is torn down.
devm_drm_dev_alloc() and drmm_mode_config_init() sets this up.

drmm_kcalloc() is the DRM version of devm_kcalloc() which frees the
memory when the last DRM fd is closed. There might be open fd's when the
device goes away so the devm_ versions can't be used.

No, I don't see why.

This was a design requirement since I wanted to make room for at least
HID touch and maybe audio. It will also tolerate other vendor class
interfaces and just silently ignore them.

The Pi images on the wiki has the ability to add a serial console USB
interface for debugging.

The number of properties doesn't change, it is returned by
GUD_REQ_GET_CONNECTOR during probe.
There is a small comment in gud_connector_fill_properties() but I can
expand on that and put it before the function definition.

Thanks for your scrutiny.
