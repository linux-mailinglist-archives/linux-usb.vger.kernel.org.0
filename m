That's good, but that does not mean that what you are attempting to do
really is the correct thing to do.  Here you were trying to say that
this is a requirement of USB-IF, but it really is not.  This is just
wanting to add a new feature to the USB core that previously was only
out-of-tree for your devices.  Please be more specific in your
description of the problem and issues involved.

Then don't say it has anything to do with USB-IF if it does not.

That's a very big difference.  Enumeration failures happen all the time
due to horrible cables and other hardware issues.  If you are now going
to flood userspace with this information, it better be ready to handle
it and do something with it.

But, for an enumeration failure, you can't do anything with it, so why
report it at all?

There is no such requirement for the kernel to provide this information,
why can't you just do this all in userspace with the information that
you have?  You know if a device is active or bound to a driver properly,
why not just rely on that instead of making the kernel do something
different here?
