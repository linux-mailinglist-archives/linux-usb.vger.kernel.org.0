I agree it's cleaner, this way I don't have to store the interface
number in gdrm.

There are 4 callers so I think it makes sense still.

Ok.

It makes for a better read so I'll do that.

The message is printed by the caller:

	ret = gud_get_display_descriptor(intf, &desc);
	if (ret) {
		DRM_DEV_DEBUG_DRIVER(dev, "Not a display interface: ret=%d\n", ret);
		return -ENODEV;
	}

It's a debug message enabled by writing to /sys/module/drm/parameters/debug.
The reason for not making it an error message, is that I want the driver
to just ignore non-display vendor class interfaces so they can co-exist
on the device. Someone might make an open protocol gpio (vendor class)
interface driver some day, or adc, i2c, spi, rtc, or...

Thanks,
Noralf.
