Here 3-4 is problematic RealTek hub, right?

Then 3-4.3 is another hub plugged into the Realtek hub, and 3-4.3.1 (the 
device being suspended and resumed) is plugged into that other hub.

I'm concerned about devices that are plugged directly into the Realtek 
hub.  For example, did you try allowing the 3-4.3 hub in the experiment 
above to suspend and resume?
