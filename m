Yes, but I did a terrible job asking the question, so we didn't
really get an answer for this situation.  The thread on the forum is
https://forum.pcisig.com/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=1081 (requires PCI-SIG
login, unfortunately).  My question was:

  Given an RCiEP that supports PME, can firmware grant control over
  native power management events to the OS?

  The PCI Firmware spec, r3.2, sec 4.5.1, says:

    PCI Express Native Power Management Events control

    The firmware sets this bit to 1 to grant control over PCI Express
    native power management event interrupts (PMEs). If firmware
    allows the operating system control of this feature, then in the
    context of the _OSC method, it must ensure that all PMEs are
    routed to root port interrupts as described in the PCI Express
    Base Specification.

  I don't think there's a mechanism for RCiEPs to route PMEs to a Root
  Port interrupt.

  PCIe r4.0, sec 1.3.2.3, says:

    An RCiEP must signal PME and error conditions through the same
    mechanisms used on PCI systems. If a Root Complex Event Collector
    is implemented, an RCiEP may optionally signal PME and error
    conditions through a Root Complex Event Collector.

  If the OS can be granted native PME control, how does it learn where
  the RCiEP PME is routed?

And the response from Robert Gough:

  The routing of root complex devices- Root Ports and Root Complex
  Integrated Endpionts- to Event Collectors is described in the Event
  Collector's RCEC Endpoint Association Capability Structure.

  In order for OSPM to process PMEs routed to an Event Collector, the
  source of the PME is found in the PME Requester ID field within the
  Root Status register of the Event Collector, in the same way that
  PME messages from children of Root Ports are serviced.

I just posted this follow-up question:

  Thanks, that clarifies one piece. The PCI Firmware spec, r3.2, sec
  4.5.1, says that if firmware allows OSPM control of PME, all PMEs
  should be routed to Root Port interrupts. Your answer suggests that
  this should be updated to say something like "all PMEs are routed to
  Root Port *or RCEC* interrupts".

  The piece I still don't understand is what happens when firmware
  allows OSPM control of PME in a system with an RCiEP but no RCEC.
  Where are PMEs from the RCiEP routed, and how does OSPM discover
  that? Or is it simply illegal for firmware to allow OSPM control of
  PME in that case?

The system we're looking at doesn't have any RCECs, so I don't think
the Root Complex Event Collector Endpoint Association Capability (what
a mouthful :)) is applicable, but I don't think Linux currently has
any support for it, so I think we're likely to trip over similar
issues on systems that do have RCECs.

It would be good if somebody added support for that capability.
