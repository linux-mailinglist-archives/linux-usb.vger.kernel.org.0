Well, I wouldn't have proposed the patch if it only applied to a
single driver. If we add a urb::allocated_transfer_size as suggested
by David, I believe that the majority of the drivers using DMA memory
will be able to rely on that URB_FREE_COHERENT flag for the garbage
collection.

The caveat, as you pointed before, is that the developper still needs
to be aware of the limitations of DMA and that it should not be freed
in an IRQ context. e.g. no call to usb_kill_anchored_urbs() or other
functions that would lead to urb_destroy().

The CAN protocol, in its latest revision, allows for transfer speed up
to ~5Mbits. For low performance CPUs, this starts to be a significant
load. Also, the CAN PDU being small (0 to 64 bytes), many small
transfers occur.
Unfortunately I did not do any benchmark myself so I won't be able to
back my explanation with numbers.


Yours sincerely,
