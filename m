The original Kconfig was:

> config USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE
>         bool "Dual Role mode"
>         depends on ((USB=y || USB=USB_DWC3) && (USB_GADGET=y || USB_GADGET=USB_DWC3))
>         depends on (EXTCON=y || EXTCON=USB_DWC3)

Which means USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE can be enabled even without CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD.

All the dual role code does is add/remove the host/gadget controller platform devices.
It doesn't care whether there is a driver for it or not.
i.e. there is no build dependency on CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD.

Without xHCI support the host functionality will not work at all on dwc3 dual role.
So I think your Kconfig changes for USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE to depend on USB_XHCI_PLATFORM
are correct.
