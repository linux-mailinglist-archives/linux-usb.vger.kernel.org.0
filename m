I guess I see your point.  My problem then is just with the menuconfig
system, not really with this patch.

Those sorts of help don't show up unless you already meet the
dependencies or if you search for it.  And if you search for it then it
already lists the depnds so the comment isn't required...

I guess that in the olden days you used to go through the menus and
look at all the high level options and figure it out.  These days you
sort of have to know what you want already.  And then you use the search
feature to enable it.

The menuconfig system really is very broken.  I've looked at alternative
ways to do it, but it quite a bit of work involved...
