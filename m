Looking at the UVC specs, the ERR bit doesn't seem to refer to actual 
transmission error, only errors in frame generation (Section 4.3.1.7 
of UVC 1.5 Class Specification). Maybe "data discontinuity" can be 
used but the examples given are bad media, and encoder issues, which
suggests errors at higher level than the wire.

Do you know if the partially rendered frames were valid JPEGs, or 
if the host was simply making a best effort at displaying a broken
JPEG? Perhaps the fix should go to the host instead?

Following is my opinion, feel free to disagree (and correct me if 
something is factually incorrect):

The fundamental issue here is that ISOC doesn't guarantee
delivery of usb_requests or even basic data consistency upon delivery.
So the gadget driver has no way to know the state of transmitted data. 
The gadget driver is notified of underruns but not of any other issues,
and ideally we should never have an underrun if the zero-length 
backpressure is working as intended.

So, UVC gadget driver can reduce the number of errors, but it'll never be 
able to guarantee that the data transmitted to the host isn't somehow
corrupted or missing unless a more reliable mode of transmission 
(bulk, for example) is used.

All of this to say: The host absolutely needs to be able to handle
all sorts of invalid and broken payloads. How the host handles it 
might be undefined, but the host can never rely on perfect knowledge 
about the transmission state. In cases like these, where the underlying 
transport is unreliable, the burden of enforcing consistency moves up 
a layer, i.e. to the encoded payload in this case. So it is perfectly 
fine for the host to rely on the encoding to determine if the payload 
is corrupt and handle it accordingly.

As for uncompressed format, you're correct that subtle corruptions
may not be caught, but outright missing usb_requests can be easily
checked by simply looking at the number of bytes in the payload. YUV 
frames are all of the same (predetermined) size for a given resolution.

So my recommendation is the following:
1. Fix the bandwidth problem by splitting the encoded video frame
   into more usb_requests (as your patch already does) making sure 
   there are enough free usb_request to encode the video frame in 
   one burst so we don't accidentally inflate the transmission 
   duration of a video frame by sneaking in zero-length requests in
   the middle.
2. Unless there is an unusually high rate of transmission failures
   when using the UVC gadget driver, it might be worth fixing the
   host side driver to handle broken frames better instead (assuming 
   host is linux as well).
2. Tighten up the error checking in UVC gadget driver -- We drop the 
   current frame whenever an EXDEV happens which is wrong. We should 
   only be dropping the current frame if the EXDEV corresponds to the 
   frame currently being encoded. If the frame is already fully queued 
   to the usb controller, the host can handle missing payload as it 
   sees fit.
