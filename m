Why is that?

Don't you also get to a known good state if pre_reset() and post_reset() 
both return 0?  Then there's no unbinding, so the driver can just jump 
back to the start of its probe() routine.  Or fail the probe, if there 
have been too many errors.

With no unbinding/rebinding, any loops that occur will be entirely under 
the driver's control.  Then it should easily be able to avoid looping 
forever.
