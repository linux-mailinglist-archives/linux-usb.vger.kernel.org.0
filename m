Thanks, I'm sure this will come in handy, but I haven't had time to dig
into it myself yet.

Best case, all TAs need the alternate encoding, but Charles seems to
suggest it isn't that easy and in which case the answer probably lies in
these traces.

Perhaps you can even figure out how to poll for an empty TX FIFO from
it, unless Charles is able to provide some details on that separate
matter?
