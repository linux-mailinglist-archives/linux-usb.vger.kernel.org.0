Are you certain about that?  It contradicts what you said earlier, that
MAY_SKIP_RESUME doesn't affect THAW transitions.  Also, it would mean 
that a device whose subsystem doesn't know about power.may_skip_resume 
would never be allowed to stay in runtime suspend.

So for THAW, dev_pm_skip_resume() can return "true" even if 
power.must_resume is set?  That doesn't seem right.

For the RESTORE and THAW cases that is exactly the same as what I 
wrote, apart from the THAW issue noted above.

What about the runtime PM usage counter?

In other words, for RESUME transitions you want the MAY_SKIP_RESUME and
power.may_skip_resume restrictions to propagate up from dependent
devices.  And of course, the way to do that is by adding them into the
power.must_resume flag.

How do you want to handle the usage counter restriction.  
Should that also propagate upward?

And how should the result of dev_pm_skip_resume() be affected by 
SMART_SUSPEND for RESUME transitions?

Maybe this is getting confusing because of the way I organized it.  
Let's try like this:

Transition   Conditions for dev_pm_skip_resume() to return "true"
----------   ----------------------------------------------------

RESTORE      Never

THAW         power.must_resume is clear (which requires
               MAY_SKIP_RESUME and power.may_skip_resume to be set and 
               the runtime usage counter to be = 1, and which 
               propagates up from dependent devices)
             SMART_SUSPEND is set,
             runtime status is "suspended"

RESUME       Same as THAW?  Or maybe don't require SMART_SUSPEND?
               (But if SMART_SUSPEND is clear, how could the runtime 
               status be "suspended"?)

I can't really tell what you want, because your comments at various 
times have been inconsistent.
