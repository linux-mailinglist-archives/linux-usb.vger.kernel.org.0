I figured you would mention this and it was brought up in the prior
version. We've gotten lucky on these that the BT and WiFi are almost
completely independent and any shared resources are easily shared
(refcounted). I don't know if this case is the same. It seems less so
to me. In any case, 2 independent devices is not what's been done here
so far. The question is does representing USB2 and USB3 buses
independently make sense, not whether just representing this hub as 2
devices makes sense.

Why would you even need this prop? What it's attached to may not be
the host controller nor even represented in DT. You've just defined a
2nd way to represent USB devices in DT (there's always 2 ways: a tree
of nodes or a 'linked list' of phandles).

Right, as the examples you pointed out do. They just avoid the issue
of representing USB bus in DT which probably was not defined at the
time at least the first one was done. It works as long as you only
have the hub that needs special setup. If you have child devices
hanging off the hub too, then you need to represent the USB bus
structure.

If that was the goal, then I'd say the device *always* belongs under
the USB bus as that is the primary interface.

As soon as someone wants to describe a device hanging off a
"smsc,usb3503a" port, they're going to need to describe it all as a
USB bus, not under I2C. I could be wrong, but I think all the cases so
far do this. And it's not just devices, but possibly connectors (which
is a whole other set of binding issues :)), too.

Being careful with probe ordering is a sign this belongs under USB bus
and integrated in some way to USB probing.
