The "problem" of a vid:pid is that for usb-serial devices, that only
describes the device that does the conversion itself, NOT the serial
device the converter is plugged into that cares about these types of
line-wiggling.

Just like you would not want to classify all devices that met the PCI
serial class signature for this type of thing either, there is nothing
special about USB here other than it happens to be a common transport
for these signals these days.
