I thought of that as well after sending my last reply. Seems like a good
idea if we can avoid it.

Had to test it, but specifying power-domain = <CX> in &gcc and adding
the required-opp to the usb node causes CX to enter the given
performance_state.

So it boots just fine and I didn't pm_runtime_enable() gcc, so
gdsc_pm_runtime_get() will just return.

That said, I don't grasp all the details happening under the hood, so I
might be missing some details that will bite us when it comes to suspend
or power collapse?

In the case of dispcc we need it because accessing the clock registers
without it crashes the board.

dispcc has a single power-domain so ((struct device*)dispcc)->pm_domain
will automatically be filled out.

The purpose of the gdsc_pm_runtime_get() call from gdsc_enable() is to
ensure that the clock controller is powered up, so that we can access
the registers - just as you do in clk_pm_runtime_get()

So regardless of us changing how the subdomains are setup I think this
part should stay, to work for the clock controllers that need to ensure
their registers are accessible.

Giving it another look I think the current implementation in gdsc.c will
enable the parent power-domain twice; once in the core because of the
dependency from the subdomain and one by the device itself.

That said, I do find this technically correct for the dispcc case -
MDSS_GDSC has a vote and dispcc has another vote.


I don't have any objections to replacing the current
pd_to_genpd(dev->pm_domain) in gdsc's call to pm_genpd_add_subdomain()
with something carrying information from the clock driver indicating
which of the multiple power domains the gdsc should be parented by.

That would explain the current hack(?) in rpmhpd.c which states that mx
is the parent of cx - which I presume is there to say that "mx needs to
be on when cx is on".

As a side effect of all this magic though this means that my vote from
usb is actually applied to MX as well (as would it in Sandeep's original
proposal)...

As we describe multiple power-domains we won't get dev->pm_domain filled
out for us, so we need to genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_{id,name}() to get the
struct devices for each power-domain and then use those when setting up
the subdomain for each gdsc.

But per the current implementation (with the CX votes trickling down to
MX as well) we should be able to just grab genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_id(0)
in gdsc_register() and use that if dev->pm_domain isn't set - at least
until we explicitly need to vote for MX only...


Let's see what Rajendra says about the requirements here.
