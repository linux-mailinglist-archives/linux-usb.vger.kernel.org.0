Yes, it is, but retaining the B's state in an error path is also fine
so long as no changes have been made to it so far.

If B was runtime-suspended to start with and none of the suspend
callbacks invoked for it so far has done anything to it, then it is de
facto still runtime-suspended and its state need not be changed in an
error path.

Except when runtime-suspended + system-suspended is effectively the
same as runtime-suspended.

Say this is not the case and say that the device is runtime-suspended
to start with.  Then the "suspend" callback has two choices: either
(1) it can runtime-resume the device before doing anything to it,
which will also cause the device's parent and suppliers to
runtime-resume, or (2) it can update the device's state without
resuming it.

If it chooses (1), then "resume" is straightforward.  If it chooses
(2), "resume" may just reverse the changes made by "suspend" and
declare that the device is runtime-suspended.  And if it really really
wants to resume the device then, why not call runtime_resume() on it?

Say that ->resume() does nothing to the device (because it is
runtime-suspended and there's no need to resume it).  Why would the
core resume the parent etc then?
