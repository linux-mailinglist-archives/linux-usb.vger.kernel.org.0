Hello,

I've been working on a HID gadget (in userspace, using ConfigFS) that relays USB data from another device transparently, but I noticed that the HID SET_REPORT and GET_REPORT request types appear to be unusable from userspace. As best as I can tell, in `hidg_setup`, they just aren't handled. One sends empty data and the other just does nothing. Sniffing the USB traffic, the only "reply" I get is -EPIPE, which appears to be generated by the UDC driver (dwc3), and I can't access any of the data involved. The device I'm relaying requires those to work transparently.

I was wondering what would need to be done to get this to work? I've tried pivoting to using FeatureFS with ConfigFS, but there's effectively no documentation on that that I can find, and no real sample code either, so I've been groping around in the dark for the past few weeks while I previously had something that *almost* worked, save for apparently one stubbed out feature. I have no real familiarity with the intricacies of the USB subsystem, otherwise I might try to prepare a patchset myself.

Thanks,
Vicki
