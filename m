For other host controllers udev->devnum is the same as the address of the
usb device, chosen and set by usb core.

With xHC the controller hardware assigns the address, and won't be the same as
devnum.

The Clear-TT-Buffer request sent to the hub includes the address of the LS/FS
child device in wValue field. usb_hub_clear_tt_buffer() uses udev->devnum to set the
address wValue. This won't work for devices connected to xHC
