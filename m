Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. As many (most?)
kernel developer don't keep an eye on it, I decided to forward it:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216426

>  Mattia Orlandi 2022-08-29 17:04:21 UTC
> 
> System
> ------
> - Dell XPS 15 9500
> - 5.19.4 kernel
> 
> Problem description
> -------------------
> Whenever I plug and then unplug my laptop from AC power using the USB-C port, the system thinks it is still plugged in (i.e., the KDE applet reports "Plugged in but still discharging").
> If I check in Dell's BIOS, it correctly reports when the power supply is plugged/unplugged; `acpi -V` also correctly shows `Adapter 0: off-line`.
> 
> On the other hand, `upower -d` incorrectly reports `/org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/line_power_ucsi_source_psy_USBC000o002` as `online: yes`.
> Moreover, `journalctl` reports `ucsi_acpi USBC000:00: ucsi_handle_connector_change: GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS failed (-110)`.
> 
> I'm testing the LTS kernel (5.15.63) and the issue does not occur, so I assume it's a regression bug, possibly introduced in kernel 5.18 (I tried downgrading the kernel to version 5.18.16 and the issue was already present).

See the ticket for more details. Apologies if I forwarded it to the
wrong folks, I cover a lot of ground and thus sometimes get things
wrong. :-/

BTW, I'd also like to add the report to the list of tracked regressions
to ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks in the end:

#regzbot introduced: v5.15..v5.18
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216426
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
