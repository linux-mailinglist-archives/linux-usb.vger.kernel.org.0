I had impression that kernel defines interfaces which should be used and
are stable (e.g. syscalls, sysfs and so on). This case is example of
user-space relying on something not being marked as part of ABI. Instead
they found something working for them and now it is being used in "we
cannot break existing systems". Basically, AOSP unilaterally created a
stable ABI and now kernel has to stick to it.

Really, all normal systems depend on aliases or names and here we have
dependency on device address. I proposed way how AOSP should be fixed.
Anything happened? Nope.

The device address can change. The node name can change. Reverting such
changes is incorrect but my arguments why we can break existing systems
who use weird, incorrect and not stable interfaces were not accepted and
I do not have anything new in this matter.

Greg,
You also did not join the discussion but use simple revert. It's not
cooperative... what next? Serge sends the same patch to SoC tree and it
gets merged and then you revert it again?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
