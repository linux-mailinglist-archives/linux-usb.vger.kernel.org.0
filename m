I'm not so sure if it is only needed on Apple systems.

The fact that Thunderbolt PCIe ports support D3 is a property of those
devices.  It's not a property of the platform or a quirk of a particular
vendor.

Hence in my view the current location of the check (pci_bridge_d3_possible())
makes sense wheras the location you're moving it to does not.

Apple started shipping Thunderbolt in 2011.
Intel brought the first chips to market in 2010.

The date is meaningful at the code's current location in
pci_bridge_d3_possible() because a few lines further down
there's a 2015 BIOS cut-off date.

Microsoft came up with an ACPI property that BIOS vendors may set
so that Windows knows it may put a Thunderbolt controller into D3cold.
I'm not even sure if that property was ever officially adopted by the
ACPI spec or if it's just a Microsoft-defined "standard".

Apple had been using its own scheme to put Thunderbolt controllers
into D3cold when nothing is plugged in, about a decade before Microsoft
defined the ACPI property.

I'm not sure if other vendors came up with their own schemes to
power-manage Thunderbolt.  We may regress those with the present
patch.

Thanks,

Lukas
