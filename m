Not an "other issue". Shuah's [PATCH 4,5,6/6] is failing to fix NULL pointer dereference issue.
These patches simply replaces NULL pointer dereference issue (caused by preemption) with
use after free issue (caused by exactly same preemption) issue. Shuah has to understand
the consequence of calling wake_up_process() on rx thread in order to fix this NULL pointer
dereference issue.

The only fix we can safely apply now is
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210205135707.4574-1-penguin-kernel@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp .
Since I and Shuah agreed that we will remove kthread_get_run(), it is nice to fix up
frequently happening -EINTR pointer dereference issue as soon as possible.
