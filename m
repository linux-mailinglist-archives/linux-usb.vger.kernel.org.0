I have just been running this in qemu.  But yes.  I suppose the easy
way would be to print a message asking the usb device to be unplugged
and then just wait for the signal.  I might try that.

That probably explains why the breakage in big-endian was never noticed.
I am starting to wonder if anyone is actually doing big-endian for new
