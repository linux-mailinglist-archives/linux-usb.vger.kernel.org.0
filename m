Patches 1-3 are phy driver changes to add support for device
mode.
Patches 4-7 are changes related to XUSB device mode
controller driver.
Patch 8 is to enable drivers for XUDC support in defconfig

Test Steps(USB 2.0):
- Enable "USB Gadget precomposed configurations" in defconfig
- Build, flash and boot Jetson TX1
- Connect Jetson TX1 and Ubuntu device using USB A to Micro B
  cable
- After boot on Jetson TX1 terminal usb0 network device should be
  enumerated
- Assign static ip to usb0 on Jetson TX1 and corresponding net
  device on ubuntu
- Run ping test and transfer test(used scp) to check data transfer
  communication

SS mode is verified by enabling Type A port as peripheral
---
v10:
* Patches 1,2,4,5,7,8 - No changes.
* Patch 3 has braces added to one single line else condition.
* Patch 6 has update on compatible string as per suggestion from Chunfeng.

* Patches 1,2,3,4,5 - No changes.
* Patch 6 has update on compatible string as per suggestion from Chunfeng.
* Patch 7 has comment fixes as suggested by Chunfeng.
* Patch 8 has CONFIG_USB_GPIO enabled as module additionally.
---
v8:
* Patches 1,2,3,4,5,8 - No changes.
* Patch 6 has update on compatible string as per change done in [1].
* Patch 7 has issue fix, where device mode didnot got enabled after resume
  from suspend.
---
v7:
* Patches 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 - No changes.

* Patches 1,2,3,7,8 - No changes.
* Patch 4,5,6 - Comments from Rob addressed, updated usb connector driver
  compatibility string.
---
v5:
* Patches 1-3 - Commit subject updated as per inputs from Thierry.
* Patch 4 - Added reg-names used on Tegra210 in the bindings doc
* Enabled xudc driver as module instead of part of kernel in patch 8.
* Patched 5-8 - No changes.
---
v4:
* patch 1 - no changes.
* corrected companion device search based on inputs from Thierry in patch 2.
* removed unneeded dev variable and corrected value read in
  tegra210_utmi_port_reset function in patch 3.
* dt binding doc and dtb files are corrected for alignments.
  Replaced extcon-usb-gpio with usb role switch.
* Added support for USB role switch instead of extcon-usb-gpio and other minor
  comments as suggested by Chunfeng.
* Enabled xudc driver as module instead of part of kernel in patch 8.
---
V3:
* Rebased patch 1 to top of tree.
* Fixed bug in patch 2, where xudc interrupts dont get generated if USB host
  mode fails to probe. Moved fake port detection logic to generic xusb.c. fake
  usb port data is updated based on soc flag need_fake_usb3_port.
* Added extra lines whereever necessary to make code more readable in patch 3
  and 7.
* dt binding doc is corrected for typos and extcon references. Also added
  details for clocks and removed xusb_ references to clock and power-domain
  names and accordingly patch 5 is updated.
* removed avdd-pll-utmip-supply in patch 6, as its now part of padctl driver.
* Patch 8 has no changes.
---
V2:
* Patches 1-3 are new patches in this series, which splits unified features
  patch to speprated features and removes need of port-fake entry in DT.
* Patch 4 is re-arragend dt-bindings patch which incorporates previous
  patch comments to sort DT entries alphabetically, addresses name changes
  and PM domain details added.
* Patch 5-6 are re-arranged DT patches with major changes - sort entries
  alphabetically, and adds clock names.
* Patch 7 is UDC driver tegra XUSB device mode controller with major
  changes - remove un-used module params, lockinng for device_mode flag,
  moving un-needed info logs to debug level, making changes feature flag
  dependent rather than SOC based macros and other error handling in probe.
* Patch 8 has no changes.
