I saw that you annotated the plug, but not the unplug. Where does the
unplug start? There are many places where it could be, but I need to be
sure.

Also, wasn't it so that the problem is when you *replug* the dock? So
can you better describe what you're doing? Are you booting with dock
connected then disconnect and reconnect or are you booting without dock
and it fails on first plug?

What are you consider a fail here? Can't you see the xhci bus? USB
Devices don't show? What do you have on lsusb -t?

Best regards
