the problem with that is that you *know* which gadget is running
there. You know everyone of those is going to run the android
gadget. In a sense, all those multiple products are testing the same
exact use case :-)

The feature ends up being all-or-nothing, then :-) It sounds like we can
be a little nicer in this regard.

dwc3 or dwc3.1? Either way, since I left Intel I don't have access to
the databook anymore. I have to trust what you guys are telling me and,
based on the description so far, I don't think we're doing the right
thing (yet).

It would be nice if other users would test this patchset with different
gadget drivers and different platforms to have some confidence that
we're limiting possible regressions.

I would like for Thinh to comment from Synopsys side here.

right, the FIFO sizes shouldn't help much. At least that's what Paul
told me several years ago. Thinh, has the recommendation changed?

Right, I want to touch those as little as possible too :-) However, to
illustrate, the only reason I implemented FIFO resizing was because
OMAP5 ES1 had TX FIFOs that were smaller than a full USB3 packet. HW
Designer's recommendation can be bogus too ;-)

all with the same gadget driver. Also, who uses USB on android devices
these days? Most of the data transfer goes via WiFi or Bluetooth, anyway
:-)

I guess only developers are using USB during development to flash dev
images heh.
