--- Comment #7 from Philipp (philipp.shah@gmx.de) ---
I didn't had a wired mouse as I wrote report the bug first (see date and
conversation). Therefor as time went on knowledge changes. On 28th of Sept I
connected a wired mouse the first time, because I didn't had a wired mouse
before. Thus there is no problem with consistency. I'm happy of any help that I
can get with this problem but I'm not a child which should be monished and you
should be a bit more careful with your conclusions about "consistency".

..I will do dmesg log soon. Thx!
