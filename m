Asking the user, and checking the device, no Bluetooth device is listed 
by GNOME.

Good point. I removed it, and the behavior was the same.

Good idea. I did that, and disabling the BT device in the firmware 
(which took several seconds), the error was gone.

Thank you for your help. The device seems broken, but Iâ€™ll try to find 
some live system to rule out a problem with Debian.


Kind regards,
