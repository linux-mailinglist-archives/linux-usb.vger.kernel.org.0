Indeed.  In fact, I suspect that this change would make the code less 
understandable, because the reader would wonder why anybody would go to 
the trouble of jumping over a return statement.  After all, this:

	if (!test)
		jump error;
	return 0;
 error:

just looks like a strange and inefficient way of writing:

	if (test)
		return 0;

Anyone reading it would wonder what the original author was thinking.

If you really want to fix up this subroutine, you could change the two 
"return -1" statements.  They should return an appropriate error code, 
not just -1.
