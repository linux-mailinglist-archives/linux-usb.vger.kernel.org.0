Mode selection is already opt-in in the current implementation and
needs to be called by the port driver.

When integrating with existing altmode drivers, the major change will
be in the probe functions:
* When mode selection is not in use by the port driver, keep the
current behavior (automatically enter the probing altmode).
* When mode selection is in use by the port driver, do not enter the alt-mo=
de.

Port drivers that enable mode selection could also be required to
select all typec altmodes as =3DY so that they are all loaded by the
time the mode selection task runs.
i.e. the way this could work is by introducing CONFIG
TYPEC_MODE_SELECTION_SUPPORT, which selects TYPEC_DISPLAYPORT=3Dy,
TYPEC_THUNDERBOLT=3Dy, TYPEC_NVIDIA=3Dy and have port drivers select them
(i.e. CONFIG CROS_EC_TYPEC selects TYPEC_MODE_SELECTION_SUPPORT).

Does this meet your expectation for isolation?
