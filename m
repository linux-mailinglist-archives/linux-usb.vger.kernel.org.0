[Added linux-scsi to CC: list.  When discussing code in a particular

In brief, a recent change -- calling scsi_add_host_with_dma rather than 
scsi_add_host -- in the USB uas driver has caused a regression in 
performance.  (Note that the shost->dma_dev value is set differently as 
a result of this change.)  Hans has determined that the problem seems 
to be related to permanent changes in the dma_dev's settings caused by 
scsi_add_host_with_dma.

Tom pointed out that __scsi_init_queue contains a couple of questionable 
assignments:

	dma_set_seg_boundary(dev, shost->dma_boundary);

and

	dma_set_max_seg_size(dev, queue_max_segment_size(q));

where dev = shost->dma_dev -- in this case, a USB host controller.

So an important question is why decisions related to a particular SCSI 
host should affect the DMA settings of a device somewhere else in the 
heirarchy?  Sure, the properties of the USB controller should constrain 
the settings available to the SCSI host, but there doesn't seem to be 
any good reason for restrictions to go in the other direction.

Doesn't the way we handle DMA permit a child device to impose additional 
restrictions (such as a smaller max segment size) beyond those of the 
parent device which actually performs the DMA transfer?

We should be using the USB host controller, because it is the device 
which actually performs the DMA transfers.

I don't know.  But in theory it should be possible to have settings 
(like this one) which affect only the transfers carried out by the SCSI 
host, not the transfers carred out by other drivers which might use the 
same USB controller.

I assume you're referring to code in the uas driver.  There the value of 
dev is meaningless as far as DMA is concerned.  Only sysdev matters.
