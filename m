An extra clock or reset is a silly reason to have a whole other node
and driver. If there's additional blocks and registers, then yes a
glue node makes sense.

John is. His chip requires 2 resets to use the USB block and the
compatible provides that distinction. Maybe HiSilicon has a newer or
customized IP version that has 2 resets. The block could have external
RAMs (because every process has its own) which may have their own
reset. With NDA specifications and little knowledge of the full
revision history, we can really never know. Also, omitting clocks and
resets from the dwc3 node entirely is just as much not describing the
h/w (only the glue needs clocks?).

This block is the oddball. I think there's 1 or 2 other blocks where
this glue node was done, but please stop. If we did this every time
there's a variation in clocks or resets, we'd pretty much have glue
nodes everywhere.
