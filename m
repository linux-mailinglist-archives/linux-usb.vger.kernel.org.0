This is a good summary.

You're still mixing USB binding/driver and DT updates, which is what we
want for most subsystems, but not for USB.

For the next version, please split it in two series as these will go in
through two different maintainer trees.

You can link to the driver/binding series from the devicetree series and
mention to Bjorn that it should not be merged before the bindings are
in.

And please use lore for any links instead of patchwork.
