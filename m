Imho the module-name should at least give a clue to the subsystem to avoid confusion/conflicts

All of this information needs to go into the changelog text, what you
wrote there does not explain all of the above.

Why does stable matter?  If this could result in a userspace breakage,
that's not ok for any kernel change.

Why not just have any new driver not use this name, as it is, it's not
hurting anything.  Until you can guarantee that renaming this is not
going to break anything, I can not take it.
