This specific patch lead to breaking OHCI on my mom's laptop (whom was about
to buy a new one thinking the hardware had failed). I get no OHCI interrupt=
 at
all and no USB 1 device is ever detected.

I haven't really found a reasonable explanation about why that is, but here
are some notes I was able to collect:
- The issue showed up on 5.8,18 and 5.9.15, which don't include the patch
  from this series that sets distrust_firmware =3D false; This results in t=
he NPS
  bit being set via OHCI_QUIRK_HUB_POWER.
- Adding val &=3D ~RH_A_PSM; (as was done before this change) solves the is=
sue
  which is weird because the bit is supposed to be inactive when NPS is set;
- Setting ohci_hcd.distrust_firmware=3D0 in the cmdline results in not sett=
ing
  the NPS bit and also solves the issue;
- The initial value of the register at function entry is 0x1001104 (PSM bit
  is set, NPS is unset);
- The OHCI controller is the following:
00:03.0 USB controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] USB 1.1 Controller=
 (rev 0f) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
	Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Device 1aa7

Does that make any sense to you?

I really wonder what a proper fix could be and here are some suggestions:
- Adding a specific quirk to clear the PSM bit for this hardware which seem=
s to
  consider the bit regardless of NPS;
- Adding the patch that sets distrust_firmware =3D false to stable branches;

What do you think?

Cheers,

Paul
