Thanks for the report, and for forwarding it.

No, the commit does what it says, namely to fix a regression just like
the one reported here (i.e. that data was buffered in 32 byte chunks).

The offending commit was merged in 4.10-rc1 and the above fixed
corrected it 4.10-rc3.

Simply reverting the commit blamed by the bisection should only makes
things worse, at least for some device types.

Perhaps we need to set that bit 7 based on the type, even if the bit
meaning having been inverted seems a bit far-fetched.

Jonathan, could you try simply commenting out the
	
	val |= BIT(7);

statement in ch341_set_baudrate_lcr()?

Also, what chip version do you have (see debug statement in
ch341_configure())?
