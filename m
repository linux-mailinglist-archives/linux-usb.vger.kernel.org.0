Hi Alan,

Ah, yes you're right.  I was hoping that the PM runtime layer would be
utilizing the spinlock when reading out the runtime status, but even
then, we wouldn't be able to catch intermediate states with this API
(i.e. RPM_RESUMING or RPM_SUSPENDING)

Tried a few different approaches, and came up with something like the
following:

static int dwc3_gadget_pullup(struct usb_gadget *g, int is_on)
{
...
	ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(dwc->dev);
	if (!ret) {
		pm_runtime_put(dwc->dev);
		return 0;
	}
	...
	pm_runtime_put(dwc->dev);

	return 0;
}

I think this should be good to address your concern.  The only way we
would be able to ensure that the runtime PM state doesn't enter
idle/suspend is if we increment the usage count for the duration we're
accessing the DWC3 registers.  With the synchronous PM runtime resume
call, we can also ensure that no pending runtime suspends are executing
in parallel while running this code.

The check for the zero return value would be for avoiding running the
DWC3 run stop sequence for the case where we executed the runtime PM
resume, as the DWC3 runtime PM resume routine will set the run stop bit
in there.

Thanks

Wesley Cheng
