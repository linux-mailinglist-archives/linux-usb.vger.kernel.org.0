Yes, that's it.  I'm impressed that you were able to find it; I had lost 
track of it.

I guess Felipe Balbi (the USB Gadget maintainer at the time) just wasn't 
very interested in fixing the problem.

Yes, that's how it worked.  Alternatively, if the gadget driver didn't 
set explicit_status in the control-OUT request then the UDC core would 
automatically call usb_ep_queue again with a 0-length transfer to send 
the status.  That way existing gadget drivers would continue to work 
after the UDC drivers were updated, and updated UDC drivers wouldn't 
have to worry about doing an automatic acknowledge only some of the 
time.

Note that in order to avoid breaking things during the transition 
period, it would also be necessary to add a flag to the usb_gadget 
structure, indicating that the UDC driver has been updated to support 
explicit_status.

PS: There's another weakness in the Gadget API which you might possibly 
run across in your project.  It's less likely to arise because it 
involves lengthy delays.

Say there's a control transfer with delayed status, and the gadget 
driver delays for so long that the host times out the transfer.  Then 
the host starts a new control transfer before the gadget driver queues 
its status reply.  Since the Gadget API doesn't have any way to indicate 
which control transfer a usb_request was meant for, the reply that was 
meant for the old transfer would get sent to the host, and the host 
would think it was a reply to the new transfer.

This problem could be solved by adding a unique ID tag to each 
usb_request, and passing the transfer ID as an extra argument to the 
gadget driver's setup() callback.  That would explicitly indicate which 
transfer a request was meant for.  But doing this would also require 
updating every function driver and every UDC driver.  Probably not worth 
the effort, considering how unlikely it is that the situation will ever 
arise.
