I had one week off last week due to a mild infection myself, so we just=20
proceed here and now. (-:

Looks like it does what it should from quick code inspection. One could=20
nitpick some things, maybe I add some comments on GitHub.

Good to hear.

I noticed that phy_type property, but did not follow that approach, because=
=20
that USB block in SAMA5D2 has three ports, where one (A) is shared with a=20
device port, two (A and B) have embedded transceivers, and only the third (=
C)=20
has that HSIC interface, but nothing else. So the flag has no effect on por=
t A=20
and B anyways, and I would have found it misleading to set phy_type to HSIC=
=20
for the whole USB block.

I don't mind. If that's your preferred approach, I will happily test it. Wa=
s=20
the series already posted to upstream?

Yes, indeed. Thanks for your feedback.
