Thanks!

While initially debugging the crash I naively(!) tried the following
two diffs:

diff --git a/drivers/base/core.c b/drivers/base/core.c
index 14f165816742..3864af018834 100644

 			       &parent->p->klist_children);

 	if (dev->class) {
 		mutex_lock(&dev->class->p->mutex);

or alternatively

Both prevent the circular device link and therefore also the crash.
I didn't mention it because it was really just a naive thought and
I'm sure they might cause other problems. :-)

Also, on a completely different note I looked again at the chipidea USB
driver that produces this situation. To request the PHY (which ends up
in the circular device link) it does:

	/* Look for a generic PHY first */
	ci->phy = devm_phy_get(dev->parent, "usb-phy");

To me it doesn't really seem great to use the devm_* helpers on the
parent device either, so I will check if I can refactor this somehow.
Perhaps this situation can be prevented entirely.

Thanks!
Stephan
