What matters is not the distro but rather the kernel version.

You can try something like the USB20CV test program available from 
https://www.usb.org/compliancetools (assuming your card is USB-2).  
Aside from that, though, I don't know of any hardware tests that don't 
require special test equipment.

Given the circumstances you describe, it seems quite likely that you're 
dealing with a hardware problem.

The linux-usb mailing list (CC'ed) is appropriate.
