If you have already entered USB4, then all alt modes need fail to
enter with -EBUSY, just like when another alt mode was already
entered successfully. Right now the port driver is responsible of
checking USB4 status, but we can easily add a check for the usb_mode
of the partner to the typec_altmode_enter().

The default entry order will in practice be the order in which the
modes are discovered (so USB4 will always be first), but the port
drivers can of course influence this by registering the modes in a
specific order - first-come, first-served. But that is only useful if
the port driver knows the priorities of the modes.

You can leave the decision to the user space for example by adding
that "no_auto_enter", that's not a problem, but it still does not
require a new sysfs attribute file. You just use that flag to set the
default value for the "active" attribute.

In user space you use the "num_alt_modes" to see how many alt modes
there are, and then simply wait for all of them (or just the ones that
you are interested in) get registered and bind to a driver. After that
you can enter which ever you want. I don't think you need anything
else there.

If you still need some way to tell the port drivers how to prioritise
the modes without user space, then I think you need some way for the
firmware to be able to deliver that information to the driver.
