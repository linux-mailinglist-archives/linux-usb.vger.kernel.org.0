Ok I'll bite...

I'm now curious why it hasn't been a problem with the Qualcomm HW. Do
you mind please capturing a similar trace log on the db845c?  Would be
good to see a side-by-side comparison and see if, first of all, whether
the same S/G path is getting exercised (i.e. 16KiB OUT requests from ADB
userspace using AIO which then get broken up into 4K chunks by f_fs),
and what the behaviors of the reclaim_trb and giveback are when the
transfer is completed.

Preferably if you could get a trace without your patch applied that
would be great. And maybe also one after your patch just to see if the
traces are truly identical or not.

Thanks for digging into this!
