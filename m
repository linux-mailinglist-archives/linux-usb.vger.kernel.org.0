Please spell out COUNT, no need to be that terse here.

I never said it had to be complete, just self-contained for what it's
used for here. I don't want to go browsing random vendor code to figure
out what the code is doing when reviewing or modifying kernel code.

But it's not necessarily GPL compatible, which is what we care about
here.

Then again, you've already used it as reference for the protocol, so
let's keep it in.

Ok, didn't notice it was your account.

So it's really the enhanced_fxn field above right (and not about pin
alternate functions only).

Ok, does the pins maintain their state if DYNAMIC_SUSPEND is set or cleared?

It's actually mentioned in passing in the coding style, but with a
different motivation.

The general idea is just to avoid unnecessarily terse code.

My point was that the corresponding macros for cp2104 includes the pin
number in the name (e.g. CP2104_GPIO1_RXLED_MODE), which makes it clear
on which pin each alternate function is available.

Not in a single line, you initialised gpio_input to the latch values
several lines above. Please keep the logic in one place, and use
temporaries where appropriate to make the code self-documenting.

I'd prefer a comment here along the lines of those in the other gpio
init functions (e.g. "set input mode iff open-drain and high latch
value").

Ah, guess you had only tested the first port's pins? Possibly another
reason for adding a dedicated cp2108 callback.

I'll comment on the patch itself.
