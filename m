I just argued to Adam that because the capabilities can change in
reality at any time, just like you pointed out here, using a psy
hierarchy instead of trying to handle everything with a single psy is
not only more clear, it's actually safer, and definitely less "hacky"
approach.

I don't really see why would it be a problem to unregister and
register the psys in the hierarchy be a problem?
