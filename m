I'm not sure this is really a problem.

For example, the reset issue arises only when a driver does the 
following:

	Locks the device.

	Queues a work routine to reset the device.

	Waits for the reset to finish.

	Unlocks the device.

But that pattern makes no sense; a driver would never use it.  The 
driver would just do the reset itself.

There's no problem if the locking is done in the work routine; in that
case the usb-storage or uas driver would be able to carry out any
necessary resets if the work routine was unable to start for lack of
memory.

Similarly, while async wakeups might get blocked by lack of memory, the 
normal USB driver paths use synchronous wakeup.
