I tested this with dummy_hcd on top of a 5.8 kernel and I got lsusb to respond
with an error instead of the right manufacturer string, after overwriting such
a string after binding.

With the patch applied, after the string is overwritten, lsusb will show the
updated string.

Because of commit 81c7462883b0cc0a4eeef0687f80ad5b5baee5f6 ("USB: replace
hardcode maximum usb string length by definition"), the patch will need a
fixup. Should I send a v2 with my sign-off?

Thanks.
Cascardo.
