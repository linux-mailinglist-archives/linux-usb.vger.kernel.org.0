Fair enough, but if the only use case that this covers, is a testing
scenario, we don't gain much from accepting this upstream, right? We can
still support both block and nonblock, but let's at least give the
option.

yes :-)

You can still enqueue one by one, but this would turn your raw-gadget
interface more interesting for other use cases.

set_alt() needs to be supported if we're aiming at providing support for
various USB classes to be implemented on top of what you created :-)

If that's the way you want to go, that's okay. But let's, then, prepare
the code for extension later on. For example, let's add an IOCTL which
returns the "version" of the ABI. Based on that, userspace can detect
features and so on.
