I don't know of any specific examples where this would be a problem.  
But it definitely goes against the guarantee that except for unlinks, 
URBs for each endpoint are always given back in order.

There's also a guarantee that when an URB has an error status, it
causes the endpoint queue to stop.  This is necessary so that the class
driver can cancel any outstanding URBs before they run and cause even
more trouble.  Your brief outline above doesn't mention this.

On the other hand, it shouldn't be hard to maintain the order even
here.  For example, you could have a FIFO list of URBs waiting to be
given back, and the BH could always give back the URB at the front of
the list.
