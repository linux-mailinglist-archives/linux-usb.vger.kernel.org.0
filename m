Using a notifier or just a direct callback from core to the glue is an
implementation detail, but as you say we need a way for the glue to
register this before the core is fully probed.

Even with extcon, I really don't fancy the fact that we're duplicating
extcon registration in the glue and core - not to mention how it looks
in DT.

The reason for it to be synchronous is that we need the glue to be able
to register it in a way that the core can acquire it when it probes
later.

I don't think it's appropriate to work around the split model in DT.

I've not seen the need for multiple consumer of role switching yet (I
don't find this a legit target for it).

But in the case of Type-C altmode several of our boards have either an
external gpio-based SBU-pin-swapper or some redriver on I2C with this
functionality, so we need a way to tell both the PHY and this external
contraption about the orientation.
