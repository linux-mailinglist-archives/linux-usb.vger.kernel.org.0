Written From Hospital.

  It is with deep consideration that I am writing this letter of
proposal to you, I know that this message may be a very big surprise
to you,  Please do not feel disturbed for contacting  you in this
regards, It was based on the critical health condition I find mine
self.  My names are Mrs. Francisca John  Carlsen from Denmark wife of
late Mr John Carlsen, a widow and I=E2=80=99m suffering from brain tumor
disease and this illness has gotten to a very bad stage, I married my
husband for Ten years without any family members and no child.  My
husband died after a brief illness that lasted for few   days. Since
the death of my husband, I decided not to remarry again, When my late
husband was alive he deposited the sum of ($11.000.000 Eleven million
dollars.) with the Bank. Presently this money is still in bank. And My
 Doctor told me that I don't have much time to live because my illness
has gotten to a very bad stage, Having known my condition I  decided
to
entrust over the deposited  fund under your custody to take care of
the less-privileged ones therein your country or position, which i
believe that you will utilize this money the way I am going to
instruct herein.

 However all I need and required from you is your sincerity and
ability to carry out the transaction successfully and fulfill my final
wish in implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute
trust and devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that
the bank finally release and transfer the fund into your bank account
in your country even before I die here in the hospital, because my
present health condition is very critical at the moment everything
needs to be process rapidly as soon as possible.

 It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment
Manager/Partner with 35 % percent of the total fund for your effort in
handling the transaction, 5 % percent for any expenses or processing
charges fee that will involve during this process while 60% of the
fund will be Invested into the charity project there in your country
for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileges ones.

 Meanwhile I am waiting for your prompt respond, if only you are
interested for further details of the transaction and execution of
this humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the merciful
compassionate.

 May God bless you and your family.

Best Regards,
Mrs. Francisca John  Carlsen
