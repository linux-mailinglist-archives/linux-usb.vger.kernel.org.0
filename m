This is quite wrong.

The USB data types defined in chapter 9 of the USB specification can 
actually be found in include/uapi/linux/usb/ch9.h.  What 
drivers/usb/common/common.c contains is the definitions of the functions 
declared in include/linux/usb/ch9.h, which is a different file (although 
it does #include the file in include/uapi/linux/usb/).

drivers/usb/common/debug.c, on the other hand, contains definitions of 
various functions used for debugging output.  If those functions are 
declared in a header file anywhere, I can't see it.
