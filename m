Thanks for pointing that use case out.  Maybe we can consider seeing if
we can walk through all alternate interfaces for a particular function,
and resize for the largest setting?  That might be a possible
improvement made to the check_config() function.  Let me start makign
the changes for this and verifying it.

If we implement the improvement mentioned above, I think Jack's fix will
be applicable there as well.  If we resize for the largest alternate
interface, then there would be no reason for us to resize again.

Agreed, there are some use cases that we may not consider in our
platform, so I appreciate the input.
