I don't understand why you aren't giving a full description of the 
situation here.  You should say something more like this (edit to your 
taste):

In ``<uapi/linux/usb/ch9.h>`` you will find the USB data types 
defined in chapter 9 of the USB specification. These data types are used 
throughout USB, and in APIs including this host side API, gadget APIs, 
usb character devices and debugfs interfaces. That file is itself 
#include'd by ``<linux/usb/ch9.h>``, which also contains declarations of 
a few utility routines for manipulating these data types; the 
implementations are in ``drivers/usb/common/common.c``.

.. kernel-doc:: drivers/usb/common/common.c
   :export:

In addition, some functions useful for creating debugging output are 
defined in ``drivers/usb/common/debug.c``.
