Sorry to hear that. Alas there is no much can be done about it.
DT-nodes name is a subject of DT-schema convention and as we've finally
unified USB-controller nodes it shouldn't be reverted back. You can
find the final USB-controller bindings in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/usb.yaml
It strictly defines to have USB-nodes with names like "usb(@.*)".
Reverting this patch will cause the DT-bindings check procedure
failure. You can also find the naming convention defined in the
latest DT spec:
https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases/tag/v0.3

See also device-tree bindings requirements listed in the file:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/writing-bindings.rst
It says: "DO use node names matching the class of the device. Many
standard names are defined in the DT Spec. If there isn't one,
consider adding it."

As Krzysztof said in
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201221210423.GA2504@kozik-lap/
and Bjorn noted in his response to your email, the only way to solve
the problem is to fix the user-land app so one would be able to deal
with both old and new DT-nodes name. Alternatively you can just
replace the dts with older one, where the name still have
the "dwc3"-prefix.
