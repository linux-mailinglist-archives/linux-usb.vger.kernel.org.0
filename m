For the most part we seem to be in agreement.

Okay.  In any case, this is about what drivers should do, not about

All right, then those are the guarantees I was thinking of.

Based on what you said elsewhere, 4 may not be needed for SUSPEND 
(depending on the platform).

Actually, FREEZE should do 2 as well.  Doing all four is acceptable,
though not optimal.

Agreed.

Let's put it like this: The resume-side callbacks should have the
overall effect of bringing the device back to its initial state, with
the following exceptions and complications:

	Unless SMART_SUSPEND and LEAVE_SUSPEND are both set, a device
	that was in runtime suspend before the suspend_late phase 
	must end up being runtime-active after the matching RESUME.

	Unless SMART_SUSPEND is set, a device that was in runtime 
	suspend before the freeze_late phase must end up being 
	runtime-active after the matching THAW.

[I'm not so sure about this.  Wouldn't it make more sense to treat
_every_ device as though SMART_SUSPEND was set for FREEZE/THAW
transitions, and require subsystems to do the same?]

	After RESTORE, _every_ device must end up being runtime 
	active.

	In general, each resume-side callback should undo the effect
	of the matching suspend-side callback.  However, because of
	the requirements mentioned in the preceding sentences,
	sometimes a resume-side callback will be issued even though
	the matching suspend-side callback was skipped -- i.e., when
	a device that starts out runtime-suspended ends up being
	runtime-active.

How does that sound?

Again, that describes what drivers or subsystems should do, not what 
the core will do.

And this will be true whether or not LEAVE_SUSPENDED is set, right?

Are you certain you want the subsystem callback to be responsible for
setting the runtime status to "active"?  Isn't this an example of
something the core could do in order to help simplify subsystems?

And this brings up another thing the core might do to help simplify
drivers and subsystems: If SMART_SUSPEND isn't set and the device is in
runtime suspend, couldn't the core do a pm_runtime_resume before
issuing the ->suspend or ->suspend_late callback?

We're converging on a final answer!
