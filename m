Hold on! The role "none" means that the connector should not be
connected to either the host nor device.

The sysfs file we expose from the class for the role switches is
primarily meant for supporting proprietary protocols that require us
to basically override the connector USB data role. The default role
should always be selected in the drivers.

With USB Type-C connectors and alternate modes, the "none" role is
used for example when the connector is put into "USB Safe State". In
case you guys are not familiar with USB Safe State, then it is a state
(defined in USB PD specifications) for the connector where the data
lines on the connector should not be physically connected to anything.
The connector needs to be put into safe state always when entering
or exiting an alternate mode, before the final mode (USB or alternate)
is actually being set for the connector.


thanks,
