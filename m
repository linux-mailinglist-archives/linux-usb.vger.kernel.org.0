Gotcha. It seems like the UVC gadget driver implicitly assumes that EOF 
flag will be used although the userspace application can technically 
make it optional.

Summarizing some of the discussions above: 
1. UVC gadget driver should _not_ rely on the usb controller to 
   enqueue 0-length requests on UVC gadget drivers behalf;
2. However keeping up the backpressure to the controller means the 
   EOF request will be delayed behind all the zero-length requests.

Out of curiosity: What is wrong with letting the host rely on 
FID alone? Decoding the jpeg payload _should_ fail if any of the 
usb_requests containing the payload failed to transmit.

Was there a situation where usb_requests were failing but jpeg
decoding succeeded  (i.e. the host was unaware of failure)? Looking at 
the error handling on the gadget driver side, I see there is space to 
improve it, but maybe we can do it in a way that doesn't add more time 
constraints!
