Too bad. That's what I was hoping to do with this driver. There are
still boards out there equipped with uPD720200/uPD720200A that have
older firmware. If you don't have the latest firmware (which is also
from 2012), then PME and a few other things will not work (so resume
from D3 does not work for example).
