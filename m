> Just so I understand...is it really desired that userspace doesn't have the flexibility to choose which USB device is offloaded?  I know it complicates what needs to be done, but it could be just an additional feature that can be added later on.  Again, by default, we select the last USB headset plugged in to be enabled for offload by default.

If it chooses endpoint by itself perhaps you can send patch set without 
controls first? This has added benefit of less patches in series, making 
it easier to review and it won't block whole patch set by discussion on 
controls feature. Controls can be added in followup series.
