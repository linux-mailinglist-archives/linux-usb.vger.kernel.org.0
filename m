[Resending since I screwed up linux-usb mailing list address in
cut-n-paste in original email]


I recently replaced the motherboard on my desktop with an MSI B450-A
Pro Max motherboard. Since then my keybaords, mouse and tablet have
become very unreliable. I see messages like this over and over in
dmesg:

The devices I am using are:

- Logitech K360 wireless keyboard
- Wired Lenovo USB keyboard
- Wired Lenovo USB mouse
- Wired Wacom Intuos tablet

After a reset, the wireless keyboard simply stops working. Rest of
the devices keep seeing intermittent failure.

I tried various combinations of hubs and USB controllers to see what
works. MSI B450-A motherboard has USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 controllers. I
added a USB 2.0 PCI card as well for this test:

03:00.0 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] 400 Series Chipset USB 3.1 XHCI Controller (rev 01)
29:01.0 USB controller: NEC Corporation OHCI USB Controller (rev 43)
29:01.1 USB controller: NEC Corporation OHCI USB Controller (rev 43)
29:01.2 USB controller: NEC Corporation uPD72010x USB 2.0 Controller (rev 04)
2c:00.3 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Matisse USB 3.0 Host Controller

I have a bus powered USB 3.0 hub, a bus powered USB 2.0 hub and a
self powered USB 2.0 hub built into my monitor.

I have connected my devices directly into the ports on motherboard
and PCI card as well as into external hub. Here are the results I
saw when devices wee plugged into various combination of ports:

1. USB 3.0/3.1 controller - does NOT work
2. USB 2.0 controller - WORKS
3. USB 3.0/3.1 controller -> Self powered USB 2.0 hub in monitor - does
   NOT work
4. USB 3.0/3.1 controller -> bus powered USB 3.0 hub - does NOT work
5. USB 3.0/3.1 controller -> Bus powered USB 2.0 hub - WORKS
7. USB 2.0 controller -> Bus powered USB 3.0 hub - does NOT work
8. USB 2.0 controller -> Bus powered 2.0 hub - Does not work

I narrowed the failure down to following lines (this code was added
in 5.5 with commit 64cc3f12d1c7 "USB: EHCI: Do not return -EPIPE
when hub is disconnected"):

drivers/usb/host/ehci-q.c:

 217                 } else if ((token & QTD_STS_MMF) &&
 218                                         (QTD_PID(token) == PID_CODE_IN)) {
 219                         status = -EPROTO;
 220                 /* CERR nonzero + halt --> stall */

At the time of failure, when we reach this conditional, token is
either 0x80408d46 or 0x408d46 which means following bits are set:

QTD_STS_STS, QTD_STS_MMF, QTD_STS_HALT, QTD_IOC, QTD_TOGGLE

and 

        QTD_PID = 1
        QTD_CERR = 3
        QTD_LENGTH = 0x40 (64)

This causes  the branch "(token & QTD_STS_MMF) && (QTD_PID(token) ==
PID_CODE_IN" to be taken and qtd_copy_status() returns EPROTO. This
return value in qh_completions() results in ehci_clear_tt_buffer()
being called:

drivers/usb/host/ehci-q.c:
 472                         /* As part of low/full-speed endpoint-halt processi     ng
 473                          * we must clear the TT buffer (11.17.5).
 474                          */
 475                         if (unlikely(last_status != -EINPROGRESS &&
 476                                         last_status != -EREMOTEIO)) {
 477                                 /* The TT's in some hubs malfunction when t     hey
 478                                  * receive this request following a STALL (     they
 479                                  * stop sending isochronous packets).  Sinc     e a
 480                                  * STALL can't leave the TT buffer in a bus     y
 481                                  * state (if you believe Figures 11-48 - 11     -51
 482                                  * in the USB 2.0 spec), we won't clear the      TT
 483                                  * buffer in this case.  Strictly speaking      this
 484                                  * is a violation of the spec.
 485                                  */
 486                                 if (last_status != -EPIPE)
 487                                         ehci_clear_tt_buffer(ehci, qh, urb,
 488                                                         token);
 489                         }

It seems like clearing TT buffers in this case is resulting in hub
hanging. A USB reset gets it going again until we repeat the cycle
over again. The comment in this code says "The TT's in some hubs
malfunction when they receive this request following a STALL (they
stop sending isochronous packets)". That may be what is happening.

Removing the code that returns EPROTO for such case solves the
problem on my machine (as in the RFC patch) but that probably is not
the right solution. I do not understand USB protocol well enough to
propose a better solution. Does anyone have a better idea?
