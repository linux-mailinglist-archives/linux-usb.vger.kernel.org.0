Even if it only supports USB-2.0 connections, an xHCI controller is 
still an xHCI controller.  It doesn't magically transform into an EHCI 
controller.

You are not creating an EHCI controller device.  Rather, you are trying 
to restrict an xHCI controller device to make it handle only USB-2.0 
connections.  If you run lsusb on a system that has an xHCI controller, 
you'll see that the controller is bound to two USB buses: a USB-2 bus 
and a USB-3 bus.  But for both buses, the controller is xHCI -- not 
EHCI.

Your patch description is inaccurate.
