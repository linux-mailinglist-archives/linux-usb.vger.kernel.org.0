What on earth are you talking about?  This isn't true at all.

Can you provide more information about your system?  Are you using a 
PCI-based OHCI controller or a platform device (and if so, which one)?  
Can you post system logs to back up your statements?

The proper order of calls is ohci_bus_suspend, then 
check_root_hub_suspended, then ohci_suspend.  Often the first one is 
called some time before the other two.

This is completely wrong.  The hardware certainly remains accessible 
when the root hub stops running.  The HW_ACCESSIBLE flag should not be 
cleared here.

And if the Master Interrupt Enable bit is cleared, how will the driver 
ever learn if a remote wakeup request (such as a plug or unplug event) 
occurs?
