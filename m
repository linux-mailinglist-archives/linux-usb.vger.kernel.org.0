Do these chips connect as USB-3 devices or as USB-2?  (I wouldn't expect 
an audio device to use USB-3; it shouldn't need the higher bandwidth.)

In general, errors such as babble are not supposed to stop isochronous 
endpoints.

This is appropriate, for the reason mentioned above.

Do you mean "stopped device" or "stopped endpoint"?

No.  Isochronous endpoints are expected to encounter errors from time to 
time; that is the nature of isochronous communications.  You're supposed 
to ignore the errors (skip over any bad data) and keep going.

In this case it is not up to the higher-level driver.

The notion of "stopped state" is not part of USB-2.  As a result, it 
should be handled entirely within the xhci-hcd driver.

(A non-isochronous endpoint can be in the "halted" state.  But obviously 
this isn't what you're talking about.)

As far as I know, it should do its best to continue (perhaps fill in 
missing data with zeros).
