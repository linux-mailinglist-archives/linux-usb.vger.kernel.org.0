The improvement from using "64" with the bad kernel is quite large.  
That alone would be a big help for you.

However, I did see what appears to be a very significant difference 
between the bad and good kernel traces.  It has to do with the order in 
which the blocks are accessed.

Here is an extract from one of the bad traces.  I have erased all the 
information except for the columns containing the block numbers to be 
written:

00019628 00
00019667 00
00019628 80
00019667 80
00019629 00
00019668 00
00019629 80
00019668 80

Here is the equivalent portion from one of the good traces:

00019628 00
00019628 80
00019629 00
00019629 80
0001962a 00
0001962a 80
0001962b 00
0001962b 80

Notice that under the good kernel, the block numbers increase
monotonically in a single sequence.  But under the bad kernel, the
block numbers are not monotonic -- it looks like there are two separate
threads each with its own strictly increasing sequence.

This is exactly the sort of difference one might expect to see from
the commit f664a3cc17b7 ("scsi: kill off the legacy IO path") you
identified as the cause of the problem.  With multiqueue I/O, it's not 
surprising to see multiple sequences of block numbers.

Add it's not at all surprising that a consumer-grade USB storage device 
might do a much worse job of handling non-sequential writes than 
sequential ones.

Which leads to a simple question for the SCSI or block-layer 
maintainers:  Is there a sysfs setting Andrea can tweak which will 
effectively restrict a particular disk device down to a single I/O
queue, forcing sequential access?
