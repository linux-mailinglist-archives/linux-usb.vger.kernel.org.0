May be better to use a second different device (rather than loopback)
for testing so that you can separate any tx issues from rx issues.

If you're going to wait for the device fifo to clear completely you can
just use a single urb with larger (1k) buffer too.

Yeah, as long as you are certain that the generic implementation does
not work and that you indeed need to track THRE per port.

Ok, so TNOW is used for RS485 to signal that the device is transmitting.

Yes, even if the device is configured in hardware for TNOW mode (instead
of DTR function) you should still be able to control RTS (at least as
long as the device is not configured for automatic hardware flow control).
