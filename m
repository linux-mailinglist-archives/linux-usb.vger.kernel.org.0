Note: This is not a gadget driver.  You should be looking in device 
drivers.

See Documentation/driver-api/usb/error-codes.rst.  In short, -EPROTO is
one of several status codes you may get when an URB fails because the
device was disconnected.

USB connections are usually pretty reliable.  Sometimes there are
transient errors, but they are relatively rare.  No one would criticize
a driver for giving up the first time it gets an error (especially if
there was an easy way to reset it) -- but people will get annoyed if a
ton of error messages shows up on the console whenever they unplug the
device.

In general, the overall design of the driver seems to be reasonable.  
I can't judge the interfaces with other subsystems or the other aspects
of their design, but the USB part is okay.  (I haven't gone through it
in detail.)
