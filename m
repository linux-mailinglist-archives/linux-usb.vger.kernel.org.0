Thank you! I has just in the middle of pulling patches from mail archive.

Your first two patches are definitely worth applying and I'll add my
Tested-by after more testing. 3/5 is unfortunately "I do not care" as
not having use case, 4/5 is something I do not see use case either, but
I'm fine with that, except for #ifdefs, but 5/5 should be solved the
other way around - just wait until everything is written out, of course
only if USB is connected. That's what serial consoles does and that's
what I expect from kernel console.

Your patch set does not attempt to solve tty write to unconnected USB
and WARN_ON on gs_close, so I'll wait for comments to those two issues
and redo fix on top of "reimplement console support" as getting rid of
the kthread is definitely superior to fixing it :)
