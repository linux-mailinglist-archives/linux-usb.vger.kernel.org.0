I am not a native English speaker so "multi-stage macros" is just not a 
fitting wording. May be “staged macros” is better or something else…

The “this” is replacing the “init function” but when this is unclear I 
will change in a later proposal…

I will improve wording...

I understand the need for keeping the code examples. But I would like to 
inform the reader about the macros first.

Code is just better readable, even when code uses more lines. Will be 
changed in next proposal.

The big question for me is for whom is this document written? For the 
USB subsystem maintainer that has even written the code by himself? I 
guess not, but may be I am wrong. Or for the kernel newbies like me? 
Please consider that the changed lines are may be not so much of use for 
me anymore as I am in the details.

When I saw the __init and __exit code example first, I was very happy to 
see it and then I was searching in the code for it. I did not find 
“init” and “exit” and was very frustrated. I want to help others to get 
into this example more smoothly.

Thanks that you replied at all.
Thanks for your very fast reply.
