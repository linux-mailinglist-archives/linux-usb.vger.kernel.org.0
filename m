Why does a userspace tool want to walk bus types?  Shouldn't it just be
iterating over the userspace class type instead?  classes are how
devices are exposed to userspace, not through a bus.  That way if there
is a new bus type tomorrow (like this one), code will just keep working.

What does the tool actually do in the platform device's directory?
