I'm absolutly fine with that behaviour.

I tought that this was intentionally to support only the runtime-pm ops.
Okay so this means that we need to check the:
  - persist
  - do_wakeup
  - pm_qos_power_off
bits again for the suspend case. I tought I miss something and we can
reuse the current checks.
