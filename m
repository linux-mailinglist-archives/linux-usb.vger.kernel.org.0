Maybe you misunderstood the notifier I meant previous, my pointer was
calling glue layer API directly.

Role switch is from dwc3-core, when it occurs, it means structure dwc3 has
allocated successfully, you could call glue layer notifier at function
dwc3_usb_role_switch_set directly.

Function of_find_device_by_node() invoked at glue layer is usually successfully,
The dwc3_probe failure doesn't affect it, unless you enable auto-suspend,
and glue layer's runtime suspend routine depends on dwc3 core's runtime suspend
routine. Would you please describe more about dwc3-core probe failure causes
dwc3-qcom's probe has failed or in half-initialized state you said?

Like above, would you explain more about it?
