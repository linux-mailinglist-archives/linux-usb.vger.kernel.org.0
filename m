That's not a good place to document them, we'll never find them, and I
obviously missed it as well.

Please put it in a comment at the top of this file _AND_ in a comment in
the script that parses these files.

What exactly do you mean by "address" of a controller?  That will be
unique per bus-type that the controller lives on, right?

Ok, good, hub and port locations _should_ be stable, but note they have
changed at times so you will have to deal with that for the next 20+
years, are you ok with that?

"address"?  What exactly do you mean by this value?  For PCI, that will
change.

You are relying on a specific sysfs tree as well, are you able to handle
it when new devices get added to the middle of a device path?  That
sometimes happens in sysfs too.
