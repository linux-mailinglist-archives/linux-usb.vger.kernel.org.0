Dear Greg,


Thank you for the quick reply.

In your experience, do most devices take that long?

     obj-$(CONFIG_USB_PCI)   += pci-quirks.o

So all quirks are run independently of the USB “variant” (UHCI, OHCI, 
EHCI, xHCI).

Indeed, this driver is built into the Linux kernel.

     $ grep USB_PCI .config
     CONFIG_USB_PCI=y

So, should `pci-quirks.c` be split up to have more fine grained control?

Sorry, for causing some confusion. But as written above, this all 
happens before the initrd is involved.


Kind regards,

Paul
