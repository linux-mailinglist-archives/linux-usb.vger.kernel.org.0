Hi Bjorn/Robb,

Following is how my EUD design looks like

My device tree node will look like as follows


eud@88e0000 {
         compatible = "qcom,usb-connector-eud";
         reg = <0 0x88e0000 0 0x2000>,
                   <0 0x88e2000 0 0x1000>;
         interrupt-parent = <&pdc>;
         interrupts = <11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
          ports {
                 #address-cells = <2>;
                 #size-cells = <2>;
                 port@0 {
                         reg = <0>;
                         usb2_eud: endpoint {
                                 remote-endpoint = <&eud_ep>;
                         };
                 };
         };
};


@usb2 {
     dwc3 {
        usb-role-switch;
         usb_con: eud_usb_connector {
                 compatible = “usb-connector-eud", "usb-c-connector";
                 ports {
                         #address-cells = <2>;
                         #size-cells = <2>;
                         port@0 {
                                 reg = <0>;
                                 eud_ep: endpoint {
                                         remote-endpoint = <&usb2_eud>;
                                 };
                         };
               };
};


So, I am putting a connector node as a child of dwc3 node which can be 
connected to the EUD node via ports. I am keeping EUD as a separate 
device tree node.

I can get the device equivalent to the connector by doing the following 
in EUD driver

dev = usb_of_get_companion_dev(&pdev->dev);

Once I get the device, I can then do

role_sw = usb_role_switch_get(dev);

This will give me the role switch reference which can be used to set 
device or host role.

The advantage here is that

-> I am keeping the existing yamls untouched which won't be the case if 
I map EUD as child of dwc3.

->This is also consistent with EUD hardware since EUD is not a connector 
in itself but it needs a connector to function
   because it can work only in device mode so the role-switch needs to be 
done.

Let me know your thoughts regarding this.

Thanks,
Souradeep
