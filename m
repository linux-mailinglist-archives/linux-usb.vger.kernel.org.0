That's a fair stance to take. We CAN do our special cases via the
"active" sysfs node. I've had a bit more time to think about the
problem we are solving and I'd like to elaborate a little.

When we designed this mode selection task, there were two motivating factor=
s:
* The existing typec_displayport and typec_thunderbolt modules will
both automatically try to enter a mode when probing and that does not
work well. You want a deterministic entry order.
* There is no generic typec daemon for userspace on Linux and there
isn't always a need for one (i.e. UCSI systems). The kernel has the
most information about what any given system needs and should be able
to handle mode entry timing better.

For those motivating factors, I think an in-kernel mode selection as
designed in this series still makes sense. Let the kernel do the mode
selection, inform userspace when it is completed and userspace can
simply set priorities + report success/failure/errors.
One other change we will probably want to make is to turn the partner
altmode Kconfig options to boolean and roll it into the typec module.
Alt-mode module loading breaks mode selection ordering because you
can't be guaranteed the partner altmodes are loaded on the system when
you do partner altmode enumeration.

Heikki, can you confirm we are on the same page up till this point at
least? The net effect here is we are moving partner altmodes
individually entering modes to centralizing mode entry in the typec
class itself.

Also, with respect to dropping the mode_selection sysfs node and
simply using the `active` fields to override:
* How can we ensure that user space does not race with the kernel mode entr=
y?
* Should we delay exposing "number_of_alternate_modes" until after
mode selection is done? Should we keep the mode_selection sysfs (or a
similarly named file) as a read-only indicator of current status?

Thanks,
Abhishek
