More and more we are going to see devices that are attached to multiple 
buses.  In this case, one for power control and another for 
commands/data.  If DT doesn't already have a canonical way of handling 
such situations, it needs to develop one soon.

One can make a case that there should be multiple device nodes in this 
situation, somehow referring to each other so that the system knows they 
all describe the same device.  Maybe one "primary" node for the device 
and the others acting kind of like symbolic links.

Regardless of how the situation is represented in DT, there remains the 
issue of where (i.e., in which driver module) the appropriate code 
belongs.  This goes far beyond USB.  In general, what happens when one 
sort of device normally isn't hooked up through a power regulator, so 
its driver doesn't have any code to enable a regulator, but then some 
system does exactly that?

Even worse, what if the device is on a discoverable bus, so the driver 
doesn't get invoked at all until the device is discovered, but on the 
new system it can't be discovered until the regulator is enabled?
