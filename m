Maybe it should, but I'm hitting this printk in handle_tx_event:

        case COMP_BABBLE_DETECTED_ERROR:
                xhci_dbg(xhci, "Babble error for slot %u ep %u on
endpoint\n",
                         slot_id, ep_index);
                status =3D -EOVERFLOW;
                break;

Tracing in the sound driver suggests that packet belongs to
the sound data device (not the sync device), because the
URB with -EOVERFLOW status for the isochronous packet in that
URB is the last one seen there.

Interesting. I had no idea the endpoint on each side
was controlled separately.
