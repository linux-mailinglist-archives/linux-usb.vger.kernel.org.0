My decision on suggesting this patch has been based purely on the speed types
the USB core API supports and what usb_get_maximum_speed() can return.
USB_SPEED_WIRELESS type is one of the possible return values. As I can see
aside the rest of the USB speeds the wireless speed is also defined
in the kernel USB subsystem. Moreover it is used in some kernel drivers.
(See the USB_SPEED_WIRELESS enumeration constant usage.)
Are you sure that the wireless speed support has been really removed?
