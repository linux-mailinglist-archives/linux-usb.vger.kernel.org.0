Yes RQS and MSS share the same bit. When you look at Figure 11-2 then you
can see the difference in handling this bit:
1. RQS is returned by a Serial Poll (=viReadSTB()). The RQS bit is reset
after the Serial Poll. See chapter 11.2.2.1 Reading with a Serial Poll.
Therefore the RQS bit is only sent with the SRQ message and deleted after
sending the message. As a consequence the device need not to set the RQS bit
when the status request is initiated by the READ_STATUS_BYTE.

2. The MSS bit does not toggle after reading, but it is only sent in the
SCPI layer as a reponse to the SCPI query "*STB?".

This is true for 488.2 devices and when you support the Interrupt pipe.
It should be true for 488.1 devices, too, however it is very difficult to
get the whole picture from this spec.
Most people, who have written that spec, are now retired.
