Thats true in general but for devices specifically in GCC I doubt anything
is part of MX. For the Multimedia ones, yes there is a CX/MX split.

I always thought we did this only on sdm845, but now that I looked at the
code again, I realized we ended up reusing those struct definitions
and now that applies to all supported SoCs :/
I will double check but FWIK it should be needed only on sdm845, I will
send in a patch to fix that once I get that confirmed.
That said the constraints of MX >= CX exist on all SoCs but like Stephen
mentioned its expected to be taken care of by RPMh, on sdm845 though
for whatever reason that got pushed onto the clients.

right, that should not be needed from clients, RPMh should be able to handle
that internally

Atleast for GCC I think it makes sense to have only CX (since nothing should
be powered by MX), for some of the other MM controllers if it makes sense
we could perhaps look at having both, again in case we really need to
explicitly vote on MX, which I haven't seen even in downstream code (barring
the sdm845 hack)
