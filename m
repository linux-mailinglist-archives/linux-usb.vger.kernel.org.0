Hi Thinh,

Hmmm, can you help check the register description for the PRTCAPDIR on
your v1.90a databook?  (Table 1-19 Fields for Register: GCTL (Continued)
Pg73)  When we compared the sequence in the description there to the
previous versions it removed the GCTL.softreset.  If it still shows up
on yours, then maybe my v1.90a isn't the final version?

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
