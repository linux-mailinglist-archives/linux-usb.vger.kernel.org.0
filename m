I don't have any devices that use this API, so I can't be certain.  
However, I believe the devices do get registered under /sys/class/usb/.  
(Note that this directory doesn't exist when there aren't any USB class 
files.)

In any case, the USB character device files all have their major
numbers set to 180 (USB_MAJOR defined in include/linux/usb.h), so you
can identify them that way.
