Always run checkpatch.pl so you don't get grumpy maintainers telling you
to run checkpatch.pl :(

And why does external_facing come into play here?  I know you say it
above, but you should also put it here into the code for when we need to
look at it in a few months and wonder what in the world this is doing.

Also, are you SURE this is correct and will handle the hotpluggable PCI
devices in things like drawers and the like?

What is the goal here in exposing this information to userspace, who is
going to use it and what is it going to be used for?
