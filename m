I've got it the other way around, so it should have been:

"it cannot know beforehand that the supplier is going to be registered
as a child of the consumer."

Sorry.

That said, device_is_dependend() doesn't really check for "family
connections", so to speak, which it should do in principle.

That is, it should return "true" if "target" or any direct ancestor of
it is any of the devices that depend on "dev", not just when "target"
itself is any of those devices.

Let me cut a patch for that.
