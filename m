Hi Thinh ,

Thanks for the feedback.

We already wait for the ep0state to move to the setup stage before
running the run stop routine, but events can still be triggered until
the controller is halted. (which is not started until we attempt to
write to the DCTL register) The reasoning will be the same as the below
comment.

It was preferred to have it placed after the pullups_connected was set
to false, so that further ep queues would be blocked (with the added
check), and we can ensure after the stop active xfers was run, nothing
could be pending.

Also, for the hibernation case, the databook mentions that we should
issue the end transfer routine as well for the hibernation w/ device
disconnected situation. (I don't believe the current DWC3 gadget driver
supports the hibernation while device connected case, which has some
considerations we would need to address)

Do you think its better if we call the dwc3_check_event_buf() and
dwc3_process_event_buf() here?  That will handle the clearing of the
events and allow them to be handled.  There are some snippets in the
databook, which mentions that we don't need to handle/process the
events, and just acknowledge them. (it mentions this in the hibernation
section)

We aren't getting any events after the controller is halted, but before
we go and try to clear the run stop bit.  I added a print in the run
stop API after clearing the RS bit, and there were pending events in the
controller at that time.  It might be redundant to have this if we are
disabling the IRQ already before the run stop call.

I see, so maybe to ensure we don't block the PMU event, we can remove
this, and rely on the disable_irq() and the run stop API to ensure no
events will be pending.

Sure, I can consider that as well.
