I will see if I can test this, but it may be difficult. The add-on
Renesas card allows my USB cables (with quite large ferrites to keep RF
out of the PC) to fit in, the Intel host ports are in a different
orientation and so physically too close together for the ferrite-laden
cables to fit in.

If I can manage to test it I will report, but don't hold your breath.

It's certainly working for me, but as I don't know much about how the
xhci driver initialises and finds the two bus host controllers I don't
know about any consequences beyond the boot delay issue that prompted
the async change in the first place.

I think that EHCI and UHCI are older standards, I don't know if the
hardware those drivers work with is still common. I also have a VIA PCI
USB card on another machine that also uses the xhci driver and it's much
older than the machine with the Renesas card. I don't think I have the
hardware that would allow me to test those drivers.

Please ask if there is any extra patch you would like me to try.
