What the OS wants can evolve, so designing around the current needs of 
the OS is not how bindings should be done.

Using overlays to add clocks or resets wouldn't really work given they 
are spread out over the tree. And with clocks in particular, you'd have 
to replace dummy fixed clocks with actual firmware clocks. Sounds 
fragile and messy...

Sigh, this is why I dislike incomplete examples...

Based on that,

Acked-by: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

And please get gpio and ts converted to schema and referenced here 
before the next time I look at this.

Once we get tired of supporting all the different firmware interfaces 
and the mess they become, we'll just have to start refusing custom ones.
