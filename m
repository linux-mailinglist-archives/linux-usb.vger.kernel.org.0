I do suggest that we directly switch all targets to use the new
implementation.

But that switch happens in Devicetree blobs (.dtb files) that are:
1) Entering the upstream kernel through a different maintainer
2) In some cases managed as through a separate software delivery
mechanism - so it's possible that users run v6.15 with a DTB from v6.13.

The opposite will be the case. The new driver will support extcon and
usb_role_switch, while the legacy one can't support usb_role_switch. The
layering violations can't be resolved in the old driver, so the issues
stemming from this can't be fixed.

If we pick this up soon, and then take one release to convert all the
Devicetree source, we should be ready to drop the legacy implementation
after next LTS, i.e. by the end of this year.

Yes, my intention is to transition all devices to the new binding asap -
including pre-type-C ones that uses extcon.

No, there isn't really a protocol, given that in the Devicetree
community we give a promise to the users that such breakage shouldn't
happen. (In the same way as you shouldn't have to update BIOS on your PC
to boot a new version of Linux)

That said, I'm arguing in favor of such breakage, as the problem is
limited (and we give a little bit of grace period) and the fact that
the current implementation is a dead end.
