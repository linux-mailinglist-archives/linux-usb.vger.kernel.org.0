It's probably 5+ years since I ran into something using platform_data,
had totally forgotten about it.

Defining a dwc3_platdata to allow the glue drivers to pass a function
pointer (and Wesley's bool) to the core driver sounds like a possible
way out of this.

Went spelunking in drivers/base again, and I think you're right.

of_find_device_by_node() looks for devices on the platform_bus's klist
of devices, so if of_platform_populate() ends up successfully getting
through device_add() the we will find something. It might not have
probed yet, but as long as we don't rely on that we should be good...

Right, if we hit qcom_dwc3_resume_irq() before the core driver has
probed it certainly looks like we're going to hit a NULL pointer.

Bryan had a previous patch where the glue layer was notified about role
switching (iirc) and as soon as we hit a probe deferal in the core
driver we'd dereference some pointer in the glue layer. I don't find the
patch right now, but I suspect it might have been caused by the same
platform_get_drvdata() as we see in qcom_dwc3_resume_irq().

I could, but I guess if we use platform_data to pass the callbacks to
the core it doesn't matter if the core driver probes synchronously or in
a week (except if the glue hits qcom_dwc3_resume_irq(), but if that can
happen it can be fixed separately)...
