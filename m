The resizing algorithm operates only on one Configuration at a time.
If a new Configuration is selected by the host, the algorithm starts
over again, so all of the endpoints in the new config will need to be
evaluated and resized again.  The number of total endpoints in a
configuration (including across multiple Alt Settings) is taken into
account to ensure there is enough room to guarantee each IN endpoint
will have a minimum amount of FIFO space, but also allowing an
opportunity for those endpoints who could benefit (based on their
MaxBurst setting) to be allocated more.

IMHO I think it's pretty straightforward, as the GTXFIFOSIZ(n) register
must have a valid value for the EP to be operational.  The assumption is
if it's 0, that means it was cleared by dwc3_gadget_clear_tx_fifos() and
we haven't yet visited this EP for resizing.  So the check within this
resize routine is basically a combination of the following:

 if (dwc->do_fifo_resize && DWC3_GTXFIFOSIZ(N) != 0)
    // this IN EP has been resized

But I hear you about using an explicit flag as it would make it crystal
clear to the reader.  I can prepare something for V2.
