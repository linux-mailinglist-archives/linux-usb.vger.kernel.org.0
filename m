Normally drivers do not have to worry about races between their probe 
and exit routines.  The exit routine should unregister the driver from 
its bus subsystem, and unregistration is supposed to wait until all 
probe and remove functions have finished executing.

I'm not familiar with u132_hcd, but the probe routine shouldn't need to 
use and "exiting" variable at all.

Are you certain there really is a problem?

Why does the driver need a static list?

You should look at other drivers for comparison.  They don't have to 
face this kind of problem.  u132_hcd should be similar to them.
