No idea, it all depends on the device.  And is 60ms really that long to
initialize the USB controller?  That's a complex beast.

What control do you need here?

And yeah, I see, but this code has to be run at early-startup to match
the USB spec requirements for handing off the USB control from the
BIOS/firmware/whatever, to the kernel.

Try changing your BIOS settings to not have "legacy" USB support in it,
that could cause this transition to go faster, at the expense of not
being able to use a USB device before Linux boots.

And is this really the slowest thing at startup for you that it is the
last thing that needs to be optimized?

No problem, I was confused as well :)
