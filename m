But there can't really be an LPM enable/disable race, can there?  The 
individual function calls are protected by the bandwidth mutex taken by 
the usb_unlocked_{en|dis}able_lpm routines, and the overall LPM setting 
is controlled by the hub device's lpm_disable_counter.

So I think you don't need to lock the hub here.
