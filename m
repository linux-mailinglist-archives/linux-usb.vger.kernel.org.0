Okay, thanks for checking.

Few additional side paths here, though. This is supposed to work so that
once the host router sleep bit is set the driver is supposed to allow
the domain to enter sleep (e.g it should not be waken up before it is
fully transitioned). That's what we do:

1. All tunneled PCIe Root/Downstream ports are in D3.
2. All tunneled USB 3.x ports are in U3.
3. No DisplayPort is tunneled.
4. Thunderbolt driver enables wakes.
5. Thunderbolt driver writes sleep ready bit of the host router.
6. Thunderbolt driver runtime suspend is complete.
7. ACPI method is called (_PS3 or _PR3.OFF) that will trigger the "Sleep
Event".

If between 5 and 7 there is device connected, it should not "abort" the
sequence. Unfortunately this is not explict in the USB4 spec but the
connection manager guide has similar note. Even if the connect happens
there the "Sleep Event" should happen but after that it can trigger
normal wakeup which will then bring everything back.

Would it be possible to enable tracing around these steps so that we
could see if there is hotplug notification somewhere there that is not
expected? Here are instructions how to get pretty accurate trace:

https://github.com/intel/tbtools?tab=readme-ov-file#tracing

Please also take full dmesg.

It is entirely possible that this has nothing to do with the issue but I
think it is worth checking.

The second thing we could try is to check the wake status bits after
this has happened, like:

  # tbdump -r 0 -a <ADAPTER> -vv -N 1 PORT_CS_18

(where <ADAPTER> is the lane 0 adapter of the USB4 port the device was
connected).

The third thing to try is to comment out TB_WAKE_ON_CONNECT in
tb_switch_suspend(). This should result no wake even if the device is
connected. This tells us that it is really the connect on USB4 port that
triggered the wake.

These could (also) explain why the host router appears to be in D3 even
if it should be in D0 already.
