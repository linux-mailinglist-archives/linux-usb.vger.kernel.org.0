Well, sorry about that.

Right, which is because in those cases there is no "middle layer" between
the driver and the core and if you want the driver to work both with
something like genpd or the ACPI PM domain and without anything like that,
the core needs to take those actions for consistency.

That's because if the core gets to executing ->suspend_late, PM-runtime has
been disabled for the device and if the device is runtime-suspended at that
point, so (at least if SMART_SUSPEND is set for the device) there is no reason
to do anything more to it.

Right, because there are drivers that don't want devices to stay in suspend
after system resume even though they have been left in suspend by it.

Arguably, they could be left in suspend and then resumed after the completion
of system suspend, but that would add quite a bit of latency if the device
needs to be accessed right after the system suspend is complete.

As documented AFAICS.

That's because (2) is the THAW case and I was distracted before I got
to documenting it properly.  Sorry.

The problem is that if you leave the device in runtime suspend, calling
->freeze_late() or ->freeze_noirq() on it is not useful and if you have
skipped those, running the corresponding "thaw" callbacks is not useful
either (what would they do, specifically?).

There is a whole problem of whether or not devices should be left in
runtime suspend during hibernation and I have not had a chance to get
to the bottom of that yet.

I guess you mean the check in device_prepare().

Well, fair enough, but then I'm not sure if there is a good place for this
check at all, because drivers can briefly disable PM-runtime at any time in
theory.

I guess the point is that in theory the device can be runtime-suspended
between device_prepare() and _device_suspend(), is by checking the status
in the former, we lose the opportunity to leave it in suspend if that
happens.

OK, fair enough.

Right, which is related to the kind of work in progress situation regarding
the flags and hibernation mentioned above.  Again, sorry about that.

That's because it's for the middle-layer (subsystem-level) code to let the
core know that skipping the resume would be OK.

The core doesn't need that flag when it decides by itself.

I am certainly not going to reject any help. :-)

Also, I'm not against clarifying anything that is not clear enough.

Cheers!
