They are not "other/new" changes. The same thing was done in the
earlier version of the problematic commits, before I was given the
idea that we can/should set dma_dev to the "chosen device". With the
dma_dev setting approach the exact same clamping will be applied twice
at different points so we don't have to invalidate the earlier one.
But now since we no longer do so, the two clamping are / can be
different, so we need to invalidate the earlier one when we are not
overriding the default max_sectors in each case.

Either I accidentally missed him or the list I copied from did that
already. Sorry.

If you are referring to the alloc/configure move in the problematic
commit, it was a trivial / code consistency change. It has nothing to
do with what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is the
else-clause add in the first patch of the current series. I don't know
if you simply missed it or it just seemed much trivial to you, either
way it was "simple" there merely because the uas driver doesn't set
its own "default" max_sectors (and hence has no comment for it) but
use the one set in the SCSI layer. Most importantly, it's an
*adapation* that makes these patches change *nothing* from the current
behaviour but only switches back to scsi_add_host().
