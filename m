Device tree for the Lenovo Thinkbook 16 G7 QOY

The Laptop is a Snapdragon X1 / X1 Plus (Purwa) based device [1].

Supported features:

- USB type-c and type-a ports
- Keyboard
- Touchpad (all that are described in the dsdt)
- Touchscreen (described in the dsdt, no known SKUss)
- Display including PWM backlight control
- PCIe devices
- nvme
- SDHC card reader
- ath12k WCN7850 Wifi and Bluetooth
- ADSP and CDSP
- GPIO keys (Lid switch)
- Sound via internal speakers / DMIC / USB / headphone jack
- DP Altmode with 2 lanes (as all of these still do)
- Integrated fingerprint reader (FPC)
- Integrated UVC camera
- X1-45 GPU

Not supported yet:

- HDMI port.
- EC and some fn hotkeys.

Limited support yet:

- SDHC card reader is based on the on-chip sdhc_2 controller, but the driver from
the Snapdragon Dev Kit is only a partial match. It can do normal slow sd cards,
but not UHS-I (SD104) and UHS-II.

Notes:

- Putting the camera behind usb_2_dwc3 results in the camera switched off after 30
seconds. With the stand-alone node as previously defined it stays usable and
suspends, as intended. Since the sole reason for the USB camera to be in the
devicetree is the required extra supply (which is guessed, as mentioned), and
its handling by power management, I would propose to keep it this way.

- The gpi_dma nodes appear to be implicitly enabled when a serial device is used.
I added them, no change in behaviour, though. Since this would be the only X1
device adding them afaik, I left them out.

- The cma-memory is removed, it is not on all x1 devices as I assumed.
Haven't found a case where it is required.

- i2c2 defines the keyboard and 4 different touchpad interfaces. With the bundling
of the pinctrl it seems to work better. I've had issues with only clock and touchpad
pinctrl on the i2c2 node, and not keyboard.

This work was done without any schematics or non-public knowledge of the device.
So, it is based on the existing x1 device trees, dsdt analysis, using HWInfo
ARM64, and pure guesswork. It has been confirmed, however, that the device really
has 4 NXP PTN3222 eUSB2 repeaters, one of which doesn't have a reset GPIO (eusb5
@43).

I have brought up the Thinkbook over the last 5 months since the x1p42100-crd
patches were available. The laptop is very usable now, and quite solid as a dev/
test platform.

Big thanks to Aleksandrs Vinarskis for helping (and sort of persisting) on the
fingerprint, camera and HDMI issues.
