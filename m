Yes, MAY_SKIP_RESUME, as well as power.may_skip_resume for that matter, really
should not affect the THAW transition at all.  I overlooked that when I was
writing the above (and earlier).

This means that the dev_pm_skip_resume() logic really is relatively
straightforward:
 - If the current transition is RESTORE, return "false".
 - Otherwise, if the current transition is THAW, return the return value
   of dev_pm_skip_suspend().
 - Otherwise (so the current transition is RESUME which is the only remaining
   case), return the logical negation of power.must_resume.

Not really, because I want the core to set power.may_skip_resume for the
devices for which dev_pm_skip_suspend() returns "true" if the "suspend_late"
subsystem-level callback is not present.  [It might be more consistent
to simply set it for all devices for which dev_pm_skip_suspend() returns
"true" and let the subsystems update it should they want to?  IOW, the
default value of power.may_skip_resume could be the return value of
dev_pm_skip_suspend()?]

But it cannot be the other way around.

For example, invoking ->thaw_early() from the driver without the corresponding
->freeze_late() would be a bug in general, unless they point to the same
routines as ->runtime_resume() and ->runtime_suspend() (or equivalent),
respectively, but that need not be the case.

OK then.

Yes, it applies to that too.

Of course, if dev_pm_skip_suspend() returns "true", the usage counter cannot
be greater than 1 (for the given device as well as for any dependent devices).

Yes, I do.

Right.

Yes, it should.

Not directly, just through power.must_resume.

Right.

Like I said above:

 THAW			dev_pm_skip_suspend() returns "true".

 RESUME		power.must_resume is clear (which requires
				  MAY_SKIP_RESUME and power.may_skip_resume to be set and
				  the runtime usage counter to be = 1, and which 
				  propagates up from dependent devices)

Nothing else is really strictly required IMO.

Sorry for the inconsistencies, I hope that it's more clear now.

Cheers!
