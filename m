Thanks for explaining the rationale.
Of course, I defer to Greg & your decision on this :)

I'm yet unable to grasp what benefit userspace gets from having the kernel parse
and present this data in appropriately named sysfs files when the userspace has
enough info to do so itself.

For that reason and also because the "raw" approach is IMO a bit more
resilient to the changes
we talk about (some product type VDOs being dropped off across PD spec
uprevs [1] etc)
the "raw" proposal sounded appealing to me.

SG. To clarify, will you prepare these patches?

Thanks & best regards,
