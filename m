Loading a driver module whenever DT says a device exists?  Not a bad 
idea.  I don't know what would be involved, but no doubt it is possible.

Note that, except for a few special cases, the kernel identifies the 
appropriate driver for USB hubs not by the VID/PID but instead by the 
device class or interface class.  I suppose the compatible string could 
include that information too?

True.  On the other hand, how common do you think it would be for 
drivers not to want to mess with the power settings?
