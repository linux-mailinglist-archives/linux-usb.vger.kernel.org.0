[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the syzbot reports that have (re-)occurred in the last 7 days, I've manually
marked 67 of them as possibly being bugs in the usb subsystem.  This category
mostly includes USB driver bugs, but it might include some core USB bugs too. 
I've listed these bug reports below.

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close it by sending a '#syz
fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the original thread, as
explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the usb subsystem, please let me know
and (if possible) forward it to the correct place.

Note: in total, I've actually assigned 97 open syzbot reports to this subsystem.
But to help focus people's efforts, I've only listed the 67 that have
(re-)occurred in the last week.  Let me know if you want the full list.

Here are the bug reports:
