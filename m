OK.

I tested 256M because IO timeout is often triggered in case of
qemu-ehci, and it is a long-term issue. When setting up the disk
via xhci-qemu, the max request size is increased to 1MB from 120KB,
and IO pattern changed too. When the disk is connected via uhci-qemu,
the transfer is too slow(1MB/s) because max endpoint size is too small.

However, I just waited 16min and collected all the 1GB IO log by
connecting disk over uhci-qemu, but the sector of each data IO
is still in order.

The 'cp' test is buffered IO, can you reproduce it every time by
running copy just after fresh mount on the USB disk?

Yeah, it should be correct except for the change on __blk_mq_delay_run_hw_q=
ueue()
is duplicated.

The data won't be very big, each line covers 120KB, and ~10K line
is enough for cover 1GB transfer. Then ~300KB compressed file should
hold all the trace.
