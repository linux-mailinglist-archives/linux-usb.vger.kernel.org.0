The sysfs ABI quoted by Dmitry above is a little vague.  It seems to 
say that only certain buses can determine whether a device is 
removable, but this simply isn't true, because any device downstream 
from something removable will itself be removable, no matter what kind 
of bus it's on.

Yes, the bus must be at least partially responsible for _determining_ 
the value of the removable attribute.  But the attribute should _apply_ 
to all devices, regardless of what bus they are on.

To be more precise, the bus can determine whether a device's upstream 
link (the first link in the chain leading from the device back to the 
CPU) can be hot-unplugged.  The device is removable if any of the links 
in that chain are hot-unpluggable.

sysfs already contains a lot of mostly unused information.  I don't 
think adding one or two more will hurt much.
