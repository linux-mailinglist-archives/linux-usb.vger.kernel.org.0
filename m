I ran these changes on our internal branches, which were probably
missing some of the recent changes done to the DWC3 drivers.  Will fix
the above compile errors and re-submit.

In regards to how much these changes have been tested, we've been
maintaining the TX FIFO resize logic downstream for a few years already,
so its being used in end products.  We also verify this with our
internal testing, which has certain benchmarks we need to meet.

I agree that the application of this logic may differ between vendors,
hence why I wanted to keep this controllable by the DT property, so that
for those which do not support this use case can leave it disabled.  The
logic is there to ensure that for a given USB configuration, for each EP
it would have at least 1 TX FIFO.  For USB configurations which don't
utilize all available IN EPs, it would allow re-allocation of internal
memory to EPs which will actually be in use.

I've been referring mainly to the DWC3 programming guide for
recommendations on how to improve USB performance in:
Section 3.3.5 System Bus Features to Improve USB Performance

At least when I ran the initial profiling, adjusting the RX/TX
thresholds brought little to no benefits.  Even in some of the examples,
they have diagrams showing a TXFIFO size of 6 max packets (Figure 3-5).
 I think its difficult to say that the TX fifo resizing won't help in
systems with limited, or shared resources where the bus latencies would
be somewhat larger.  By adjusting the TX FIFO size, the controller would
be able to fetch more data from system memory into the memory within the
controller, leading to less frequent end of bursts, etc... as data is
readily available.

In terms of adjusting the AXI/AHB bursting, I would think the bandwidth
increase would eventually be constrained based on your system's design.
 We don't touch the GSBUSCFG registers, and leave them as is based off
the recommendations from the HW designers.

As mentioned above, these changes are currently present on end user
devices for the past few years, so its been through a lot of testing :).
