Kernel already uses raw_spin_lock_irqsave(), see pci_lock_config() macro
in pci/access.c which implements this global lock for config space
access.

But issue is that pci-driver.c does not wait for finishing transfer and
return from function which unlock this spin lock...

Week ago I fixed this issue in U-Boot and similar fix would be needed
also for kernel https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/eccbd4ad8e4e

But this issue is not related to my original report about XHCI & PCI.

Issue is different. You cannot do config space PIO transfer while
another config space PIO transfer is in progress.

I really hope that memory read or write transfer can be initiated while
config transfer is in progress. Marvell A3720 platform on which can be
found this pci aardvark controller is 2 core CPU SoC.

At least I have not seen any abort when PCIe link is up, card connected
and previous config access transfer finished.

Has kernel API & infrastructure for catching these aborts and executing
own driver handler when abort happens?
