Hi Bjorn,

By making EUD Role-Switch provider and client do you mean that
we should have a EUD node which will have a connector node as
child and this connector node will have a port that points towards
the drd role-switch?

So that my device tree node will look like the following in that case

eud@88e0000 {
         compatible = "qcom,usb-connector-eud";
         reg = <0 0x88e0000 0 0x2000>,
               <0 0x88e2000 0 0x1000>;
         interrupt-parent = <&pdc>;
         interrupts = <11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
         usb_con: connector {
                 compatible = "usb-c-connector";
                 label = "USB-C";
                 port {
                       eud_usb_output: endpoint {
                       remote-endpoint = <&eud_usb3_input>;
                  };
         };

};


@usb2 {
     dwc3 {
        usb-role-switch;
        port {
              eud_usb3_input: endpoint {
                    remote-endpoint = <&eud_usb_output>;
              };
      };
};

Also EUD functions only in device mode, so when the role-switch is done 
by the controller
to set the device mode, the PC on the other end becomes the host.

Thanks,
Souradeep
