I don't have the exact numbers for the uac feedback isoc endpoint
at the moment. But without the patch applied, it was reproducably
returning with EXDEV when we started uvc streaming and therefor
increased the amount of events per interrupt thread cycle.

With the patch applied however, we are able to only route the events to
the corresponding soft irqs and leave the moment of truth to the
scheduler.

Why should explicit handling of coherent ep events on one cpu core
introduce more latency then by interleaving different events for
arbitrary ep all in one thread?

Possible, but not unsolvable.

I doubt that it will be worse if each softirq can be handled on
different cpus at the same time.

Let's make sure we will not break anything on the way. Okay? :)

I actually thought that this is even requested:
