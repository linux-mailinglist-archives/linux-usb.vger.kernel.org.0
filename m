It would indeed seem so. The way gadget driver is architected makes 
is impossible for the userspace application to notify the host of 
any errors.

I was aware of linux doing so, but I only ever saw this behavior on 
Windows if there were a lot of invalid frames back to back.

I am not super familiar with the guarantees of JPEG, but I suppose 
it is possible to have a "valid" JPEG with some middle blocks
missing as long the EOI bits make it through? I am not sure how we 
go about solving that.

The main reason for queuing the requests from the complete handler
was to have a single point of usb_ep_queue call, which made reasoning 
through the locking simpler. But if you find a way to do so from 
the video_pump thread without making the locking a nightmare, then go
for it!

Agreed!

Currently, if uvc gadget driver receives an EXDEV complete callback
all it does is set the UVC_QUEUE_DROP_INCOMPLETE flag.

So let's say that we receive an EXDEV for a usb_request containing data
for video frame N. With how video_pump is currently configured, chances 
are that all usb_requests containing data for video frame N has already 
been queued to the controller. 

When the next video frame (N+1) comes in, video_pump's encode methods 
will look at the UVC_QUEUE_DROP_INCOMPLETE flag and incorrectly 
determine that "current" frame needs to be dropped, and stop encoding
video frame N+1 even though the error was for video frame N. So the
encode methods incorrectly drop video frame N+1 which isn't needed. 

The encode methods should only be dropping the video frame if we 
received an EXDEV for a usb_request for the video frame currently 
being encoded. 

I hope that makes sense!
