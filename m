One factor that I forgot is USB2 vs USB3.
The Pi's have a USB2 Device controller (dwc2). I couldn't find a cheap
board with a USB3 Device controller that could run mainline Linux, so I
haven't tried that.

I got a question if this would work with usbip[4], USB over IP.
I did a quick test with two Pi4's connected by cable to the same network
switch (1Gb). Showing a movie in a window like my previous test didn't
show much of a difference. Maybe some occasional glitching, hard to tell
without proper tests.

There's no pageflipping on the device side, so it could be tearing that
I saw.
