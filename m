Here's a proposal, along the lines of your first suggestion above.  The 
idea is to avoid holding the connect_lock mutex while invoking a gadget 
driver's callbacks.

Unfortunately, this is unavoidable in the case of the ->disconnect() 
callback, but that's okay because the kerneldoc already says that 
->disconnect() may be called in_interrupt, so it's not allowed to call 
any core routines that may sleep.  Just to make this perfectly clear, 
the patch adds a couple of comments along these lines.

As far as I can tell, there is no real reason to hold connect_lock 
during the ->unbind() callback.  Not doing so should fix the problem in 
the UVC function driver.

Let me know if this works.
