That's reasonable IMV.

This is not just about the parent, but also about suppliers and things
get fairly complicated at that point, so I would just rely on the
observation that runtime wakeup should trigger shortly.

I personally think that it would be reasonable to simply preserve
device states in error paths unless they have been changed already
before the error (or suspend abort due to a wakeup signal).

By this rule, B would be left in runtime suspend if it were still in
runtime suspend when the error (or suspend abort in general) occurred
and then it doesn't matter what happens to A.

The PM core can do something like that for the drivers opting in for
runtime PM integration assistance, so to speak.  That is, drivers that
point their ->suspend() and ->resume() callbacks to
pm_runtime_force_suspend() and pm_runtime_force_resume(),
respectively, or set DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND (or both at the same time
which is now feasible).  Otherwise, it is hard to say what the
expectations of the driver are and some code between the driver and
the PM core may be involved (say, the PCI bus type).
