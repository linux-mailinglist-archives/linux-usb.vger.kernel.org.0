As a proof of concept it should be sufficient to just add an
implementation of sc->pd.set_performance_state in gdsc.c. But I agree
that it would be nice to push this into some framework code, perhaps
made opt-in by some GENPD_FLAG_xyz.

Yes and this is already working for the non-nested case - where the
single power-domain jumps between performance states as the opp code
switches from one opp to another.

So if we can list only the child power-domain (i.e. the GDSC) and have
the performance_stat requests propagate up to the parent rpmhpd resource
I think we're good.


Let's give this a spin and confirm that this is the case...

In one way or another we need to invoke pm_genpd_add_subdomain() to link
the two power-domains (actually genpds) together, like what was done in
3652265514f5 ("clk: qcom: gdsc: enable optional power domain support").

In the case of MMCX and CX, my impression of the documentation is that
they are independent - but if we need to express that CX is parent of
MMCX, they are both provided by rpmhpd which already supports this by
just specifying .parent on mmcx to point to cx.
