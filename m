Do you mean the "retval == STATUS_SUCCESS" checks?  Those checks would 
end up doing exactly the same thing as they do now, since 
USB_STOR_TRANSPORT_ERROR and -EIO are both different from 0.

Yes, it is true that consistency is important.  But correctness is more 
important than consistency.

Let me put it this way: Suppose you changed the USB_STOR_TRANSPORT_ERROR 
in rts51x_read_mem() to -EIO, without changing anything else.  Wouldn't 
that fix the problem reported by the clang static analysis?  If not, why 
not?
