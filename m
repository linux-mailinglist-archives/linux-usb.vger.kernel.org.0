Bjorn are you exercising dual-role or just host mode?

This. When switching dwc3 into peripheral mode we also need
dwc3_qcom_vbus_override_enable() to write those registers to manually
drive the UTMI VBUS valid signal high to the controller since our SoCs
are never physically wired to the connector's VBUS. These registers
(QSCRATCH_{HS,SS}_PHY_CTRL) however don't belong to the PHYs but are
part of our dwc3 wrapper's IO map and hence dwc3-qcom is the only
appropriate place to handle them since dwc3-qcom has over the years
paired with several different PHYs depending on SoC.

Wesley's approach in $SUBJECT was to designate dwc3-qcom itself as a
usb-role-switch-able device so that in the DT the connector graph
endpoints would wire to the dwc3-qcom device itself instead of its dwc3
core child. The idea would be for dwc3-qcom would intercept the
role_switch_set call from TCPM/UCSI, call the vbus_override_enable() and
then pass on the notification to the child to let dwc3/drd.c handle the
rest.

IIRC there had been an alternate proposal to keep the role switch
connection only at the dwc3 core but in order to handle the vbus
override business an additional notification would have needed to be
done either from the usb_role_switch class driver or as an "upcall" from
dwc3 core -> glue. (found it, it was by you Bryan [1])
