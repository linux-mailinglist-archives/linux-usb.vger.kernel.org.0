Ah, yes.  This should have been added years ago; guess I forgot.  :-(

Initially, we didn't want the PM core to do this automatically because
we thought some devices might want to remain runtime-suspended
following a system resume, and only the device driver would know what 
to do.

Raphael, now that we have the direct_complete mechanism, can we revisit 
this?  Should the PM core automatically call pm_runtime_set_active() if 
dev->power.direct_complete isn't set?  Perhaps in device_resume_early() 
prior to the pm_runtime_enable() call?

It's possible we discussed this and decided against it at the time when 
direct_complete was added, but if so I don't remember what was said.
