As expected, and:

xrgb8888=aabbccdd
32-bit access:
r=bb
g=cc
b=dd
Byte access on BE:
r=bb
g=cc
b=dd

I've done similar tests in the past and did another before my last mail.

We agree about endian effects. Apologies if I came across as overbearing!

Okay, "[31:0] x:R:G:B 8:8:8:8" can certainly mean
[31:24]=x [23:16]=R [15:8]=G [7:0]=B, which when stored "little endian"
becomes B G R X in memory, for which your pix32 code is correct.

That's the reverse *memory* layout of what the name says :) but yes,
the name then matches the representation seen by software. That's the
"abstracted" case that I didn't expect, because I thought the name was
refering to memory layout and because I was thinking about how traditional
graphics adapter video memory has the R component at the lower
address, at least in early linear modes.

I also didn't pay attention to the fbset output:

    rgba 8/16,8/8,8/0,0/0


With drm format describing software pixel representation and per the
fbset rgba description my test file was incorrect. I've recreated it
with B G R X bytes and it shows correctly with your pix32 code.

Sending data directly to the device without the gud driver uses
different data, so isn't actually a fair comparison, but I didn't
change the device at all now, and that still works.

And swab would be required on a LE machine with a graphics adapter in
a mode with X R G B memory layout, or that system would just never
present XRGB8888 for that adapter/mode but perhaps something called
BGRX8888 instead? I see.

Ack.

Ack.

So your destination rgb565 buffer has a [15:11]=R [10:5]=G [4:0]=B
pixel format, which stores as B+G G+R in memory, as opposed to R+G G+B.
All right.


Thanks a lot for clearing up my misunderstanding of drm format names
and my endianess concerns!
