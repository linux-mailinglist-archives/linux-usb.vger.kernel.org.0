I've looked at Documentation/core-api/dma-api-howto.rst again which mentions that

	By default, the kernel assumes that your device can address 32-bits of DMA
	addressing.  For a 64-bit capable device, this needs to be increased, and for
	a device with limitations, it needs to be decreased.
	[...]
	These calls usually return zero to indicated your device can perform DMA
	properly on the machine given the address mask you provided, but they might
	return an error if the mask is too small to be supportable on the given
	system.  If it returns non-zero, your device cannot perform DMA properly on
	this platform, and attempting to do so will result in undefined behavior.
	You must not use DMA on this device unless the dma_set_mask family of
	functions has returned success.

which, unless I'm reading this incorrectly, should mean that asking for a 64bit
mask is always fine. In the worst case the mask will just be downgraded to
32bit if the bus is correctly annotated (the places I looked at that use the mask
take the min of that one and dev->bus_dma_limit).
Only asking for a mask that is too small would be bad.

I have also found [1],[2] which made changes to that documentation and that also
seems to confirm that it's fine to just ask for a 64 bit mask either way.


So for these cases

the call should return success but the final mask used for allocations should
remain at 32bit. Before the change no memory above the 32bit limit was used by
the dwc3 core and after the change we still can't use any memory above the
32bit limit.


Now if we had a dwc3 controller with
 * a quirk that only allows 32bit DMA for the core dwc3 controller
 * but support for >32bit DMA for xhci buffers (xhci already asks for a 64bit mask) 
 * on a bus that's otherwise annotated to support 64bit
this change will break that.

But that's unrelated to the dma_set_mask_and_coherent return value since
just calling it with a 64bit mask will already cause trouble (and also be successful!).

The problem I see is that we likely wouldn't know about devices with a quirk like this
since so far everything has been working fine there. I'm not really sure how to guard
against that either since we would only notice on the first DMA transfer above the 32bit
limit. I'm also not sure how likely the existence of such a weird device is.

This hypothetical dwc3 controller should probably either be confined to a bus with a 
proper 32bit limit or get a quirk that enforces allocations from ZONE_DMA32. Doesn't
change the fact that they used to work but would now break after this patch.
