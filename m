While testing this driver I encountered the following issue if I do the following.

1) USB port is "otg" and nothing connected so it is in IDLE mode to begin with.
   i.e. HCD & UDC not registered.

2) Load mass storage gadget with backing medium.
   > modprobe g_mass_storage file=lun stall=0

[   28.172142] udc-core: couldn't find an available UDC - added [g_mass_storage] to list of pending drivers

3) Connect port to PC host

Is opening the backing file from irq_thread_fn the issue here?
If yes, how to resolve this?
