No worries. It took me a while to understand hat code, and I initially
also thought it was wrong, so you are in good company.

Padding to DMA cache line size doesn't fix the real problem. The dwc2
IP expects input buffer size to be a multiple of wMaxPacketSize.
dwc2_hc_start_transfer() has the following code(where wMaxPacketSize ==
chan->max_packet).

		if (chan->xfer_len > 0) {
                         num_packets = (chan->xfer_len + chan->max_packet - 1) /
                                         chan->max_packet;
			...
		}
		...
		if (chan->ep_is_in)
			chan->xfer_len = num_packets * chan->max_packet;

If, for example, wMaxPacketSize is 64, and the original xfer_len is, say,
1522 (as observed in our case), xfer_len is updated to 1536, and the chip
is programmed to receive up to 1536 bytes. In most cases, padding the
buffer to the DMA cache line size (64 in our case) catches this, but not
if xfer_len is much lower than wMaxPacketSize.

My code tries to address that situation, but as Boris noticed there is
still something wrong with my fix.
