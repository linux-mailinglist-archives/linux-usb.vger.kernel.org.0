Hi Thinh,

Thank you for your input.  In this case (if kick transfer fails w/ an
error), would we still need to mess with the enqueue/dequeue pointers?
Not sure if my assumption is correct, but the TRB wouldn't have been
started, so we can use the same (failed) TRB for future requests, right?

I think one thing I will need to update is to loop through num_trbs and
clear all HWO bits if the above is not needed.

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
