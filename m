Wait -- why isn't it considered suspended?  We saw at 57.211022 that 
1-1-port3's Suspend feature really was set, and thanks to your patch, 
the kernel should now believe that the port is suspended.

Don't worry about this part.  Naturally anything associated with the 
1-1.3 hub will fail after the resume of 1-1-port3 is messed up.  Fix the 
first problem (failure to resume the port) and the second problem is 
likely to go away.
