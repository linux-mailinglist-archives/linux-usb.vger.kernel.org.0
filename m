Hi all,

I'm now on kernel 5.2.16, from Fedora, and still I
see the same issue.

I guess it is not a chipset quirk, since there
are two involved here.
For the USB 2.0 I've (with "lspci"):

USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 USB EHCI Controller (prog-if 20 [EHCI])

For USB 3.0 I've:

USB controller: ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM1042 SuperSpeed USB Host Controller (prog-if 30 [XHCI])

Any idea on how to proceed?

Thanks a lot.

bye,
