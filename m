I have a nagging feeling that this description may be too vague for a
lot of people to understand.  Does everybody know what an "onboard"
USB hub is?

Consider for example that Intel's current EHCI host controllers all
come with a USB hub built into the chipset.  That built-in hub
certainly could be considered "onboard", but it doesn't need this
driver.

Maybe also give some examples of devices that require this driver, to
help make the idea clear to readers.

You're assuming that node->udev->bus->controller is going to be the
same for the nodes on the list, right?

Instead of this cumbersome two-condition test, how about simply
having a hub->is_powered_on flag?  Then
hub->has_wakeup_capable_descendants wouldn't be needed.

Why have an explicit kfree here but not anywhere else?  And if you do
have an explicit kfree, why use devm_kzalloc rather than plain kzalloc?

This test is wrong.  Look at the definition of list_for_each_entry;
node will never be NULL.  Probably the best approach is to use a local
"ret" variable.

Shouldn't this routine unbind the onboard_hub_usbdev driver from all
the associated devices?  Otherwise you end up with more-or-less
dangling references to hub (I say more-or-less because with the devm
allocations, the structures will hang around as zombies for a while).

Relying on the onboard_hub_power_off call to do this for you isn't a
great idea, because the effect won't happen immediately.

Ignoring the return code?  Then why does that routine return int rather
than void?

Ditto.

Is there a matching get_device somewhere (like in _find_onboard_hub)?
If so, I didn't see it.  And I don't see any reason for it.
