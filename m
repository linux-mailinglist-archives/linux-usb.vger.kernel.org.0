Hi,

I tested the patch.

Assumming I did everything properly, add patch,
test, issue not showing up, remove patch, re-test,
issue present.

It seems this patch you provide solves the issue.

Thanks a lot for the support and the solution.

I guess now this patch will be integrated into
mainline sometimes.
Please let me know, in this thread or directly, in
which kernel it will be available.

Thanks again, it would be for me impossible to
solve without your support,

bye,
