We can check the xhci_reset() return value here and print a message, makes sense.

The original reason for the 10 second timeout was because a host actually took 9 seconds:

commit 22ceac191211cf6688b1bf6ecd93c8b6bf80ed9b

    xhci: Increase reset timeout for Renesas 720201 host.
    
    The NEC/Renesas 720201 xHCI host controller does not complete its reset
    within 250 milliseconds.  In fact, it takes about 9 seconds to reset the
    host controller, and 1 second for the host to be ready for doorbell
    rings.  Extend the reset and CNR polling timeout to 10 seconds each.
