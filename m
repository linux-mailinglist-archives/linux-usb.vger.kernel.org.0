If you copy code directly (even if you clean it up after) you should
include it, but not necessarily if you just use it for reference for the
protocol.

It doesn't hurt mentioning anyway when you add the reference to the
vendor driver, for example:

I think it's ok to keep, as reference. You do dump this data later even
if you don't currently use this union I noticed.

Perhaps you can run some isolated experiments if you haven't already.
Submitting just a single URB with say 128, 512 or 1024 bytes of data and
see when/if you ever receive a transmitter holding empty interrupt.

How does the vendor driver handle this? Does it really wait for the THRE
interrupt before submitting more data?

You could try increasing the buffer size to 2k and see how much is
received on the other end if you submit one URB (e.g. does the hardware
just drop the last 1k of data when the device fifo is full).

I understand, but the generic implementation is not a good fit here as
it actively tries to make sure the device buffers are always full (e.g.
by using two URBs back-to-back).

If you can't find a way to make the hardware behave properly then a
custom implementation using a single URBs is preferable over trying
to limit the generic implementation like you did here. Perhaps bits can
be reused anyway (e.g. chars_in_buffer if you use the write fifo).

Setting these two should make core make sure that the endpoints exist,
and by default they will be assigned to the first and second port, but
you can override that calc_num_endpoints() (as you already do).

For the second IN EP, you could even let core allocate the URB and use
that instead of doing so manually (e.g. by submitting yourself or using
the generic read implementation as mxuport does).
