Heh, I sent this RFC to prevent learning the hard way (by actually creating
incorrect patches), that we want to be consistent, but using dev_*() calls
rather than composite.h utils. That's ok.

Which brings an interesting question: should the ultimate goal be to remove the
messaging utils altogether from composite.h? It _seems_ their purpose is mainly
to wrap dereferencing a pointer two pointers away: &(d)->gadget->dev to make
invocations shorter. With the default of 100 columns in checkpatch nowadays it
is maybe a less important goal? Or maybe we should prevent such long
dereferencing by introducing helper variables just like below in
u_audio_start_capture()?

Nothing? If making messaging consistent meant using the utils from composite.h,
then in this particular case we would unnecessarily go through & -> -> each
time, which is described in the following paragraph, which is avoided by using
the local variable "dev". Given that the preferred way to unify messaging
is using dev_*() calls, my question 2 becomes irrelevant.
