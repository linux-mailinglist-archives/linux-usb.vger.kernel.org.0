How do you know that the author used a dev board? And are you really
sure that there are no devices out there which always operate in this
mode?

I understand why you did it. My point is that you cannot just claim that
PID and say that it's only to be used for I2C/SPI without even trying to
make a case for why that should be ok.

We obviously don't want a second serial driver for these devices.

That's unfortunate. In principle, your approach is the right one, that
is, to use a dedicated PID do determine when to configure an alternate
mode. But since we already know that some people are using the PID in
question in serial mode, it's not that clear cut.

How do you intend to switch between i2c and spi mode?
