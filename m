It's a very puzzling situation.

One thing which probably would work well, surprisingly, would be to buy 
an old USB-1.1 hub and plug it into the PCI card.  That combination is 
likely to be similar to what you see when plugging the devices directly 
into the PCI card.  It might even work okay with the USB-3 controllers.

The USB and EHCI designs are flawed in that under the circumstances 
you're seeing, they don't have any way to tell the difference between a 
STALL and a host timing error.  The current code treats these situations 
as timing/transmission errors (resulting in device resets); your change 
causes them to be treated as STALLs.  However, there are known, common 
situations in which those same symptoms really are caused by 
transmission errors, so we don't want to start treating them as STALLs.

Besides, I suspect that your code change does _not_ make the USB-2 
controller work reliably with your devices.  You should collect a usbmon 
trace under those conditions; I predict it will be full of STALLs.  And 
furthermore, I believe these STALLs will not show up in a usbmon trace 
made with the devices plugged directly into the PCI card.  If I'm right 
about these things, the errors are still present even with your patch; 
all it does is hide them.

Short of a USB bus analyzer, however, there's no way to tell what's 
really going on.
