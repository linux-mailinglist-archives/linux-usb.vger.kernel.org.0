Hi

This looks like a developer list I'm sorry to bother you here as I'm not 
a developer, I was looking for the linux-usb-user list but it seems to 
have merged with this so i will ask my question here.

I'm trying to get the g_mass_storage module to export an 8Tb storage 
device, either using a backing file or an iscsi mounted device, it seems 
to fail anything more than 2Tb. Is the module limited to 512 bytes 
blocks or is there a way to force larger blocks?


Kind regards

 Â  Kim Bak
