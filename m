It=E2=80=99s not about the number of people, or the work being out of =
reach for a
single person, but more of someone asking themselves why it should be =
them to
do it when there=E2=80=99s no big project like Nova or Tyr to justify it =
and employ
them to do it all, vs employ them only for the actual drivers but not =
for the
abstractions. Or if they=E2=80=99re working on their free time, it =
becomes even
harder to justify spending energy on the abstractions if all they want =
is
to write a driver.

But if anyone got the impression that it is impossible to do it, my bad. =
It
isn=E2=80=99t.

Yeah, point taken :)

As I said to Greg above, I=E2=80=99m here to help if anyone wants to =
write a USB
driver. Those interested are free to reach out to me and we will work =
together
to merge the required abstractions with a real user in mind. Hopefully =
this
encourages others to join in this work :)
