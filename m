So both places that indicate USB 3.1 support are not according to latest spec,
SBRN (Serial Bus Release Number) is 30 instead of 31, and supported protocol
capability minor revision is 0x1 instead of 0x10.

Most reliable way of checking the current actual port speed is reading protocol speed id
from the ports PORTSC register port-speed field.
Use debugfs: (with your correct pci address and port number)

cat  /sys/kernel/debug/usb/xhci/0000\:00\:15.0/ports/port13/portsc
Powered Connected Enabled Link:U0 PortSpeed:4 Change: Wake:

PortSpeed:4 is default for SS 5Gbps, Gen1x1
PortSpeed:5 is defaulf for SSP 10Gbps, Gen2x1

I recall similar numbers in Linux, ~500-550Mb/s with a USB 3.1 to SATA adapter
and fast SSD. Reading with dd

Is the xHCI controller id PCI D0 state even when runtime suspeded?
Some ACPI tables end up preventing D3 for runtime suspend, keeping controller in D0
and possibly preventing PME# wake signaling
