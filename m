X-Mailing-List: linux-usb@vger.kernel.org

Avoiding phy powerdown in host mode when wakeup capable devices are 
connected, so that it can be wake up by devices.
Set GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag to keep usb30_prim gdsc active
when wakeup capable devices are connected to the host.

Changes in v5:
Added phy_power_off flag to check presence of wakeup capable devices.
Dropped patch[v4,4/5] as it is present linux-next.
Addressed comments in host.c and dwc3-qcom.c.

Changes in v4:
Addressed Matthias comments raised in v3.

Changes in v3:
Removed need_phy_for_wakeup flag and by default avoiding phy powerdown.
Addressed Matthias comments and added entry for DEV_SUPERSPEED.
Added suspend_quirk in dwc3 host and moved the dwc3_set_phy_speed_flags.
Added wakeup-source dt entry and reading in dwc-qcom.c glue driver.

Changes in v2:
Dropped the patch in clock to set GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag and 
setting in usb dwc3 driver.
Separated the core patch and glue driver patch.
Made need_phy_for_wakeup flag part of dwc structure and 
hs_phy_flags as unsgined int.
Adrressed the comment on device_init_wakeup call.
Corrected offset for reading portsc register.
Added pacth to support wakeup in xo shutdown case.
