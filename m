Doesn't look like FreeBSD at least has an frevoke() syscall anymore, it
had an FREVOKE flag, which is now a define for the O_VERIFY option
which has quite different semantics:
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sektion=2&query=open

"O_VERIFY may be used to indicate to the kernel that the contents of
the file should be verified before allowing the open to proceed.  The
details of what "verified" means is implementation specific. The run-
time linker (rtld) uses this flag to ensure shared objects have been
verified before operating on them."

The AIX frevoke() also has different semantics:
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=f-frevoke-subroutine

"All accesses to the file are revoked, except through the file
descriptor specified by the FileDescriptor parameter to the frevoke
subroutine."
and:
"Currently the frevoke subroutine works only on terminal devices."

The point of USBDEVFS_REVOKE, and the other variants is to revoke
access to the device, not to the file descriptor itself.

If you're reticent to adding new ioctls, we could try and do that
exclusively through BPF. The only thing that didn't look like the BPF
codepath could do was wake up the fd so that fd could be poll()ed and
error out immediately.
