Did you just chose to not read what Krzysztof said here? It must be used
only when that's the sole interrupt, which he stated is not the case for
your platform.

I look at the binding and noticed that interrupt-names isn't even a
required property by snps,dwc3.yaml, and this comment about driver
behaviour likely isn't accurate given that the code in for host mode
(and the others are identical) is written so that it will grab the first
interrupt if the specific names it looks for are absent:
| static int dwc3_host_get_irq(struct dwc3 *dwc)
| {
| 	struct platform_device	*dwc3_pdev =3D to_platform_device(dwc->dev);
| 	int irq;
|=20
| 	irq =3D platform_get_irq_byname_optional(dwc3_pdev, "host");
| 	if (irq > 0) {
| 		dwc3_host_fill_xhci_irq_res(dwc, irq, "host");
| 		goto out;
| 	}
|=20
| 	if (irq =3D=3D -EPROBE_DEFER)
| 		goto out;
|=20
| 	irq =3D platform_get_irq_byname_optional(dwc3_pdev, "dwc_usb3");
| 	if (irq > 0) {
| 		dwc3_host_fill_xhci_irq_res(dwc, irq, "dwc_usb3");
| 		goto out;
| 	}
|=20
| 	if (irq =3D=3D -EPROBE_DEFER)
| 		goto out;
|=20
| 	irq =3D platform_get_irq(dwc3_pdev, 0);
| 	if (irq > 0)
| 		dwc3_host_fill_xhci_irq_res(dwc, irq, NULL);
|=20
| out:
| 	return irq;
| }

Since it grabs the first interrupt, as a fallback, in order to support
not having the interrupt-names property, the name of the first interrupt
ultimately doesn't matter at all to this driver (and likely any other
driver written in compliance with the bindings for the dwc3 core).

I'm not here to argue about what the name for the single interrupt
should be (keeping consistency with other devices might actually be
good), but ignoring what a maintainer says and the seemingly providing
an incorrect analysis is annoying. Did you perform the analysis on this
yourself, or did it perhaps come from Gemini?

Thanks,
Conor.
