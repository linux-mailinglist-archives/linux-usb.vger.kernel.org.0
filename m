Makes sense, just because we don't use opp-tables to scale the frequency
and performance_state, the issue remains the same.

But for this case - and below display case - the subdomain (the device's
power-domain) is just a dumb gate. So there is no translation, the given
performance_state applies to the parent. Or perhaps such implicitness
will come back and bite us?

I don't think we allow a power-domain to be a subdomain of two
power-domains - and again it's not applicable to USB or display afaict.

For the GDSC I believe we only have 1:1 mapping, so implementing
set_performance_state to just pass that on to the parent might do the
trick (although I haven't thought this through).

Conceptually I guess this would be like calling clk_set_rate() on a
clock gate, relying on it being propagated upwards. The problem here is
that the performance_state is just a "random" integer without a well
defined unit.



The one case where I believe we talked about having different mapping
between the performance_state levels was in the relationship between CX
and MX. But I don't think we ever did anything about that...

Yes, the various display components sits in MDSS_GDSC but the opp-tables
needs to change the performance_state of MDSS_GDSC->parent (i.e. CX or
MMCX, depending on platform).

As I said, today we hack this by trusting that the base drm/msm driver
will keep MDSS_GDSC on and listing MMCX (or CX) as power-domain for each
of these components.


So if we solve this, then that seems to directly map to the static case
for USB as well.
