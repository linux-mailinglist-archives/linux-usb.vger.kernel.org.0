I thought it was a bad thing to call usb_free_coherent() in the
completion function and that the best practice was to allocate all the
DMA memory when opening the device, reuse them during runtime and free
everything when closing the device.

Especially, correct me if I am wrong, but isn't there a risk to
trigger below warning if calling usb_free_coherent() in an IRQ context
(which is the case in the completion function)?
