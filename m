It's not - it's after writing PCI_PM_CTRL, but before reading it back.

I also checked PCI_COMMAND before writing PCI_PM_CTRL, it's the same
value 0x403.
Immediately after writing PCI_PM_CTRL, it holds the same value.
10ms later (after pci_dev_d3_sleep()), it holds the same value.
Another 10ms later, it has value 0.

PCI_PM_CTRL stats with value 0x103.
Then 0 is written and pci_dev_d3_sleep() delays 10ms.
At this point it has value 0x3.
After an additional 10ms delay, it has value 0.

Vendor ID remains 0x1022 at all points.

I stubbed out that register write which would have otherwise applied
to 8 PCI devices (but not the XHCI controllers), it still fails in the
same way unless the delay is increased.

It looks like we can detect that the reset has failed (or more
precisely, not quite completed) by reading PCI_COMMAND (value not yet
0) or PCI_PM_CTRL (doesn't yet indicate D0 state, we already log a
warning for this case).

From that angle, another workaround possibility is to catch that case
and then retry the PCI_PM_CTRL write and delay once more.
