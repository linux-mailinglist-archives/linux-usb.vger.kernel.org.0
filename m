No matter what we do with these values, it does not change the fact
that we do not know is the cable USB4 or TBT3 at the moment. What ever
we do, we are guessing things.

Can you please explain your concern again? What can happen if we use
USB4 cable but claim that it is TBT3 to the mux?

Let's not come up with values that are not defined in the spec for
this field (or any other). Even though it is unlikely, we can not rule
out the possibility that one day value of 0x0000 is defined for that
field.

I'm strongly against this kind of "modifications". It would mean that
the member tbt_cable_vdo does not actually contain TBT3 Cable VDO, but
instead it has to be considered as driver or subsystem specific data.

This case will not work. The tbt_cable_vdo member is now 0, which to
the mux driver means that the cable is USB4 cable (and that is what it
really must mean to the mux driver - any mux driver). The mux driver
will therefore enable unidirectional SBU communication even though it
is actually bidirectional, and also rounded data rates even though the
cable supports only non-rounded data rates.

I may be missing something, but I'm still going to say that let's just
claim that the cable is always TBT3 for now in this driver. That is
the only safe bet that we have.
