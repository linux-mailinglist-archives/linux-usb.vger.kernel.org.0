TBC, I'm against repeating a 'pwrseq binding' like MMC has which is a
separate node. That's how the referenced binding started out IIRC, but
I was fine with what's in v16. I'm not against common/generic code for
handling pwrseq for 'simple' cases, but we need to allow for complex
cases and not try to keep extending some generic binding to handle
every last quirk.
