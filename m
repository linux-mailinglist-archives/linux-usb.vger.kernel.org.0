I have no objection for you just taking this whole series as-is, no need
to worry about merge conflicts with the USB tree, I doubt anything will
be touching this area of code anytime soon.

So if you want to take it now, feel free to add:

Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

to all of these.

Or, if you really like/want a branch to pull from, I can do that as
well, which ever is easiest for you to work with as you all are doing
the hard work here, not me :)

thanks,
