Hi Felipe,

I agree...Resizing the txfifo is not as straightforward as it sounds :).
 Would be interesting to see how this affects tput on other platforms as
well.  We had a few discussions within our team, and came up with the
logic implemented in this patch to reserve at least 1 txfifo per
endpoint. Then we allocate any additional fifo space requests based on
the remaining space left.  That way we could avoid over allocating, but
the trade off is that we may have unused EPs taking up fifo space.

I didn't consider branching out to changing the gadget framework, so let
me take a look at your suggestion to see how it turns out.

OK, I can add that.

Sure, of course.

Sorry forgot to mention that this is something we caught internally with
our testing using the older txfifo resizing change.  As mentioned above,
let me dive into this suggestion a bit more.

Thanks
