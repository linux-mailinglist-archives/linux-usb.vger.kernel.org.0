That was the behaviour before all that command execution refactoring
this summer. I'm not saying that it's right, but that's how it was.

The decision to Cancel was made to work around buggy EC firmwares that
reported BUSY, and then never completed the command. So without that
Cancel hack, the PPM was stuck on those systems.

I don't know what we should do about that hack. We probable could just
ignore those old systems, and then add quirks for them as needed. But
I also don't really like what you are proposing in this patch, that we
basically ignore the BUSY bit completely.

Right now I was hoping that we return the behaviour of the driver to
a point where everything worked as before, and after that start
improving the driver. That's why I was hoping to hear does the problem
that you are seeing go away with that approach.

With which command do you guys get the busy notification?

In any case, I don't think all those ucsi_*_common() functions give us
enough room to move here. I feel that the command execution needs to
be refactored somehow again.

thanks,
