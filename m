Hi,

thanks for providing more insights on the USB hardware!

It's not clear to me how this case would be addressed when (some of) the
handling is done in xhci-plat.c We have two host controllers now, which one
is supposed to be in charge? I guess the idea is to specify the hub only
for one of the controllers?

Reminder that the driver is not exclusively about powering the hub, but
also about powering it off conditionally during system suspend, depending
on what devices are connected to either of the busses. Should this also
be done in the xhci-platform driver?

Since we are talking about "pre-probes" I imagine the idea is to have a
USB device driver that implements the power on/off sequence (in pre_probe()
and handles the suspend/resume case. I already went through a variant of
this with an earlier version of the onboard_hub_driver, where suspend/resume
case was handled by the USB hub device. One of the problems with this was
that power must only be turned off after both USB hub devices have been
suspended. Some instance needs to be aware that there are two USB devices
and make the decision whether to cut the power during system suspend
or not, which is one of the reasons I ended up with the platform
driver. It's not clear to me how this would be addressed by using
"pre-probes". Potentially some of the handling could be done by
xhci-platform, but would that be really better than a dedicated driver?
