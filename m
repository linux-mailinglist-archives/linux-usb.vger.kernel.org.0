Thanks for keeping this under your radar. I also have on my TODO list
to send a new version of my patch to add the `URB_FREE_COHERENT' flag
but this time adding an `allocated_length' field to struct urb. I will
wait for your patch to go first. By the way, I will be out for summer
holiday for the next couple of weeks so I wasn't planning to submit
anything soon regardless.

Yours sincerely,
Vincent Mailhol
