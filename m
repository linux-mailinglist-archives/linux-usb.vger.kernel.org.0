What exactly do you mean by "pretty big" here?  And what is wrong with
that, I have never seen any issues with the current size of that
structure in any benchmark or performance results.  All USB bottlenecks
that I know of are either in the hardware layer, or in the protocol
layer itself (i.e. usb-storage protocol).

Maybe, yes, then we could transition to allocating the urb and buffer at
the same time like we do partially for iso streams in an urb.  But that
still might be overkill for just this one driver.  I'm curious as to why
a slow and tiny protocol like CAN needs to use usb_alloc_coherent() for
its buffers in the first place.
