Unless this has changed over the years, it was a requirement from IRQ susbystem.

If you have these messages that are *really* needed, then you should add
a trace event for it. Look at the events we have on dwc3 if you need
some inspiration. Could also look at the history of our trace events to
figure out how things changed over time.
