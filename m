Well in theory, maybe. But the latter half of the sentence is the key :)

In particular, xhci-plat does the Wrong Thing before this series:

	device_set_wakeup_capable(&pdev->dev, true);

i.e., it doesn't factor any "capability" in at all; it just assumes it.

And per your thoughts below, it's still Wrong after this series.

I'm not sure either your patch nor Sandeep's patch really get at the
heart of my problem here, which is that neither dwc3 nor xhci-plat are
trying to reflect wakeup capability of the host controller at all. (And
if the host controller doesn't suppor wakeup, it doesn't really matter
what any of its children think.) It seems that
drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-imx8mp.c is the only one that actually sets the
correct wakeup flag at the level that we _really_ know what's up -- the
platform/"glue" driver.

Maybe we need to do a little of both: teach the glue drivers (e.g.,
dwc3-qcom.c) to reflect their wakeup capability properly, and then look
at *that* capability (as well as any children, recursively, but only if
the glue driver supports it) when trying to make wakeup decisions.

It still feels wrong that there are 3 separate "can wakeup"
determinations for the host controller though: 1 dwc3-{glue}, 1
dwc3(core), and 1 xhci-plat. But maybe we have to hold our noses on that
one.
