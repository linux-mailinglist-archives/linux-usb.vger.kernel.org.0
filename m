- Add a SPDX header;
- Adjust document and section titles;
- Use copyright symbol;
- Some whitespace fixes and new line breaks;
- Mark literal blocks as such;
- Add it to filesystems/index.rst.

Also, as this file is alone on its own dir, and it doesn't
seem too likely that other documents will follow it, let's
move it to the filesystems/ root documentation dir.
