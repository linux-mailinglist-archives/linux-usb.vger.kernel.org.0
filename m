As mentioned, this need has been identified a few times by now, so
nothing strange in your request/proposal.

But so far no one has come up with a good way to register glue code
callbacks with the core; we can't pass arbitrary data (such as a
function pointer to such callback), and we don't know when the core is
registered, so we can't call a register operation when that happens.
