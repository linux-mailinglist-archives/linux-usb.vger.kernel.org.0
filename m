That's great! I can't promise to to test the three-color (b/w/r) e-ink
but I'll prepare a test setup for the RGB-TFT on the weekend.

I can't really comment; I know next to nothing about the drm subsystem. :)

It would of course be lovely to be able to set up an automated DMA from
a USB endpoint to the panel in the device and not have to touch the data,
but that would require the DRM driver to support all the combinations,
which quickly becomes complicated.


> What format does your 3 bpp display use?

It supports three formats:

- R1 G1 B1 R2 G2 B2
- R1 G1 B1 X R2 G2 B2 X (your option 2)
- R1 R2 R3 (simulated monochrome, same data bit to all three subpixels)

All right!
