In more detail:

During runtime suspend:

pci_set_power_state() is called with state=D3cold
 - This calls pci_raw_set_power_state() with state=D3hot
 -- After transitioning to D3hot, dev->current_state is updated to
D3hot based on pmcsr readback

acpi_device_set_power() is called with state=D3cold
 - acpi_power_transition() is called with state=D3cold, updates
adev->power.state to D3cold
 - adev->power.state is updated (again) to D0

pci_update_current_state() is called
 - platform_pci_get_power_state() returns D3cold
 - dev->current_state is updated to D3cold

Observations: everything seems to be in order


During runtime resume:

pci_update_current_state() is called
 - platform_pci_get_power_state() returns D3cold
 - dev->current_state is updated to D3cold

pci_set_power_state() is called with state=D0
 - Calls pci_platform_power_transition
 -- Calls acpi_pci_set_power_state -> acpi_device_set_power with state=D0 :
 --- acpi_power_transition() updates adev->power.state to D0
 --- adev->power.state is updated (again) to D0
 -- Calls pci_update_current_state
 --- platform_pci_get_power_state() returns D0 (so this is ignored)
 --- dev->current_state is updated to D3 via pmcsr read
 - D3cold delay happens (good)
 - Calls pci_raw_set_power_state() with state=D0
 -- current_state is D3 so the D3 delay happens (good) (I quirked this
delay to 20ms)
 -- device is transitioned to D0 and dev->current_state is updated to
D0 from pmcsr read

Observations: everything seems to be in order, USB is working after resume


During s2idle suspend:

Exactly the same as runtime suspend above. Device transitions into
D3cold and dev->current_state ends up as D3cold. Everything seems to
be in order.


During s2idle resume:

acpi_device_set_power() is called with state=D0
 - acpi_power_transition() is called with state=D0, updates
adev->power.state to D0
 - adev->power.state is updated (again) to D0

pci_raw_set_power_state() is calld with state=D0
 -- dev->current_state is D3cold so no D3 delay happens ***
 -- device fails to transitioned to D0, pmcsr read indicates it's still in D3.

Observations: that's a pretty clear difference between the s2idle
resume and runtime resume paths.
The s2idle resume path is arrived at via pci_pm_default_resume_early()
--> pci_power_up().


Should the s2idle resume path be modified to call into
pci_update_current_state() to change the current_state to D3hot based
on pmcsr (like the runtime resume path does)?
Or should pci_raw_set_power_state() be modified to also apply the
d3_delay when transitioning from D3cold to D0?

Thanks
Daniel
