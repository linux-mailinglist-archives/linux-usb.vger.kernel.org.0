Thanks for the detailed report.

I got another report of this issue off-list a few days ago, but I
haven't got any replies to my follow-up questions from that reporter
yet.

I can't seem to reproduce the issue here and the other reporter only
saw this for some CP2102N which seems to suggest that there's some
interaction with the device configuration at play here too.

The symptoms appear to be consistent with the device still having
hardware flow control enabled while the driver thinks it is disabled.
The IXON/IXOFF limits are set in the same request and this might explain
why things get out of sync, for example, if 128/128 limits are rejected
by your device in its current configuration. But that's still to be
determined.

First, can you enable dynamic debugging in the driver through debugfs:

        echo module cp210x +p > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

or when loading the module:

        modprobe cp210x dyndbg==p

and send me the logs from when connecting the device and running you
terminal program.

After the terminal program fails, try just to issue a

	cat /dev/ttyUSB0

press control-C and then include the logs for that too.

For completeness, also include the output of

	stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 -a

after re-connecting the device and before and after running the terminal
program.
