Hi Michael,

Thanks for the analysis.  I think specifically, the f_uvc will use the
usb_function_deactivate() API to disable the pullup (w/o calling
udc_stop()) and using usb_function_activate() to do the opposite.  These
are triggered when an application opens/closes the V4L2 device. (your
application)

Seems like the deactivate/activate calls avoid any UDC start stop
operations, and only use the pullup executions to issue a soft disconnect.

Definitely, in this situation, we would not call the udc_start()
callback, which will affect the functionality after re-enabling the
device.  I wonder why the deactivate/activate routines don't explicitly
need to start/stop the UDC?

Thanks
