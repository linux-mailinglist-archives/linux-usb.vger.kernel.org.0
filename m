No, this won't "just work".  The problem is that when you write to the 
new_id file, usb_store_new_id() calls driver_attach(), which tries to 
bind the driver to any matching device.  There _will_ be other matching 
devices, and trying to bind them will cause runtime errors.

That isn't what we want.  We want to bind the driver to a _specific_ 
device and no others, even if the others match the new id.

Now, this is what writing to the sysfs "bind" file does -- except that
it won't let you bind a driver to a device it doesn't match!

So we have two problems:

	Bind a driver to a particular device,

	Even though the id's for the device don't match the driver.

The kernel already contains solutions for each of these problems, but 
nothing that can handle both at once.
