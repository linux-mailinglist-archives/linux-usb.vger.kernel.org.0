So either you have a use-after-free, or a NULL crash, either way it's
bad and the real bug should be fixed if this can happen.  If it can not
happen, then there is no need to set this to NULL.

It's odd that the ep is needed to create a request, but it's not saved.
So yes, I think it should be saved, and that will make the cleanup logic
a lot simpler, as well as allow us to use the __free() logic overall.

I think all of them need to be fixed up, and by adding the endpoint
pointer to the request, that should help make the logic overall for all
of these drivers simpler and easier to maintain over time.

So yes, if you could do that, it would be wonderful.
