Thanks for providing the clarification. So you're proposing a port-psy and a
port-partner-psy that are connected to each other (one supplying the other).
If PD is not present, those two will exist per port and partner, and there
will be information about Type-C current (and possibly BC 1.2 and other
methods?)

Do you have an example hierarchy you could share that explains what it would
look like in /sys/class/power_supply with PD with Source Caps and Sink Caps=
 on
both sides?

I think this all makes sense if the connector class is a read interface
for this info. Have you considered how the type-c connector class and this =
pd
psy support will handle dynamic PDO changes for advertisement FROM the port=
s?

For example, let's say you wanted the kernel and user to manage two USB-C p=
orts
with higher power support (meaning, 5V, 9V, 15V, 20V capable), but then your
kernel and user needs to edit the Source Caps on the fly based on load
balancing.

If caps are represented as a group of psys together, how do you as a kernel
and user create an modify the set of Source_Caps you put out on a port?

Thanks,
Benson
