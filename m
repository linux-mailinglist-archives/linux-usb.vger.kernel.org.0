That doesn't do the user (or a program the user is running) any good.  
You can't expect them to go searching through the system's DT 
description looking for this information.  All they know is the hub's 
location in sysfs.

You don't need a platform device or a new driver to do this.  The code 
can go in the existing hub driver.

Okay.  Or you could always put it in the USB-2 hub.

Incidentally, the peering information is already present in sysfs, 
although it is associated with a device's port on its upstream hub 
rather than with the device itself.
