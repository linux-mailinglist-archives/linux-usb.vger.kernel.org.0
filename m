Think of an old MSDOS operating system without USB support.  The BIOS 
tries to be helpful by translating mouse and keyboard input it receives 
over USB into PS/2 events that the operating system can handle.  
Originally this was done using SMI; now it presumably is still a legacy 
part of UEFI.

I would be surprised if anybody still knows.  :-)

Perhaps a reasonable experiment would be to boot a kernel with PS/2 
support but not USB support (or at least, without CONFIG_USB_PCI) and 
see what happens when you type on the USB keyboard or move the USB 
mouse.

It might very well turn out that the handoff operation can safely be 
delayed until driver probe time.
