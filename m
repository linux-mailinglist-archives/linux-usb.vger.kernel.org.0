That is correct.

Right.

Right.

If we have transmitted all requests of the frame but would only miss the
sentinel request to the host that includes the EOF, the host could
rather show it or drop it. The drop would not be necessary since the
host did see all data of the frame. The user would not see any
distortion in both cases.

If we have transmitted only partial data of the frame it would be
preferred if the host would drop the frame that did not finish with an
proper EOF tag.

AFAIK the linux kernel would still show the frame if the FID of the
currently handled request would change and would take this as the end of
frame indication. But I am not totally sure if this is by spec or
optional.

One option to be totally sure would be to resend the sentinel request to
be properly transmitted before starting the next frame. This resend
polling would probably include some extra zero-length requests. But also
if this resend keeps failing for n times, the driver should doubt there
is anything sane going on with the USB connection and bail out somehow.

Since we try to tackle case (1) to avoid transmit errors and also avoid
creating late enqueued requests in the running isoc transfer, the over
all chance to trigger missed transfers should be minimal.

Michael
