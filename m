data_count appears to be the number of bytes remaining in the FIFO. (I 
have to infer that much from the surrounding code. I don't have 
documentation for this controller.)

Some comments would be nice.

Apparently the aim is to increase the residual by the number of bytes that 
will never leave the FIFO. Above we can see that increase performed by 
scsi_set_resid() and now the same has to be done to the SCp struct.

Here, data_count effectively has SCp.this_residual subtracted from it.

So far, so good.

This is like saying ptr = buffer + residual, which is bogus. This must be 
an old bug, but we never hit it because the FIFO is always empty when we 
get a DISCONNECT message. Probably because every SG segment has a length 
that is a multiple of 128 bytes. (Juergen?)

Are you sure about that? Perhaps you meant to write,
		left = scsi_bufflen(CURRENT_SC) - scsi_get_resid(CURRENT_SC);

Is there a better name for this variable? Maybe 'sent' or 'bytes_sent'?

Shouldn't that be,
			CURRENT_SC->SCp.buffers_residual = i;

BTW, datao_run() seems to guarantee that the FIFO will never contain more 
than min(128, SCp.this_residual) so I suspect that this code can be 
simplified. That's just BTW. I wouldn't attempt to optimize this branch as 
it will only run when the FIFO is not empty, if ever. So I'd prefer 
clarity. Besides, I don't have the hardware to test it on.
