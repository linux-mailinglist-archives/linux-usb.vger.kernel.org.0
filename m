that really doesn't sound like a good idea, IMHO. We're still passing
through layers of abstraction without anyone's knowledge :-)

It looks to me like we're missing some infrastructure in the wakeup code
so parents can make decisions based on the state of their children.

you see, here there's an assumption that the platform data is still
valid and not some bogus dangling pointer. There's also an assumption
that the type is struct dwc3 (which is unlikely to change, but still).
