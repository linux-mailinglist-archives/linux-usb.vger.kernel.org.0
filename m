I'm still several hundred miles from the consistently-reproducible 
hardware for another couple of days yet, so I've been logging the other 
failures as they happen.

Don't worry about the printk()s WRT to the code; a couple of weeks ago 
I'd seen an NPE on resume in __tb_path_deactivate_hop so threw in a 
bunch of tb_port_info(port, "%s(): %d\n", __func__, __LINE__); so I 
could get an idea of where the crash was.

I'll have more info Sunday with the original kernel, one with the 
revert, and with some of Lukas' proposed(? not sure if they made it in 
there) changes from his previous E-mail.
