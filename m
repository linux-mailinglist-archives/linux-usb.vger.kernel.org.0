The best way to find out what will happen with the other driver is to 
try it and see.  Anything we can tell you would be only a guess.

However, as Mathias said, you really should not be using a 2.6 kernel.  
The current kernel version is 6.9, and you can imagine how much it has 
changed and improved in the meantime.
