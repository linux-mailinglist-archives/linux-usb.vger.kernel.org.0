The host controller drivers _do_ complete URBs with -EPROTO (or similar) 
status when a link-level error occurs...

but they don't mark the endpoint as halted.  Even if they did, it 
wouldn't fix anything because the kernel allows URBs to be submitted to 
halted endpoints.  In fact, it doesn't even keep track of which 
endpoints are or are not halted.

No, it isn't.

An endpoint shouldn't be marked as halted unless it really is halted.  
Otherwise a driver might be tempted to clear the Halt feature, and 
some devices do not like to receive a Clear-Halt request for an endpoint 
that isn't halted.

What we could do is what you suggested earlier: Note the fact that the 
endpoint is in some sort of fault condition and disallow further 
communication with the endpoint until the fault condition has been 
cleared.  (It isn't entirely obvious exactly what actions should clear 
such a fault...  I guess resetting or re-enabling the endpoint, or 
resetting the entire device.)
