After looking over the whole discussion, as I see it there is no
compatibility breakage in this case. But there is an improper UDC
interface usage, which has been fixed by Amit and could be ported to
another AOSP branches/tags if needed. As [1] says user-space is
able to create a USB gadget only with controllers listed in the
directory /sys/class/udc/*. That ABI doesn't change. Note the ABI
doesn't say that if someone found a file there in some kernel
version it will be available there in the in a next version with the
same name. A developer just need to search for the UDC controllers ach
time when a UDC gadget needs to be created.

Anyway as I see it the UDC gadget creation ABI IS indeed abided by
most of the developers since we haven't heard much complains so far
except from John. In case of AOSP the problem has been fixed so we can
get back the modification and proceed with the rest of the patches
review.
