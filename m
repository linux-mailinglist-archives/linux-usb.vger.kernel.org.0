I'm using Corentin's test script [0] for sending data and by
connecting RX6 to TX7 and TX6 to RX7.

For a 1024 byte buffer:
[ 3029.068311] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 509 bytes for urb 0
[ 3029.068827] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 509 bytes for urb 1
[ 3029.069363] ch348 ttyUSB7: submitted 5 bytes for urb 0
[ 3029.069902] ch348 ttyUSB7: UART_IIR_THRI - unknown byte: 0x00
[ 3029.215272] ch348 ttyUSB6: UART_IIR_THRI - unknown byte: 0x00
[ 3029.215908] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 6 bytes for urb 0
[ 3029.233628] ch348 ttyUSB6: UART_IIR_THRI - unknown byte: 0x00
-> data is received without corruption

With a 2048 byte buffer the general flow seems fine:
[ 3031.073101] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 509 bytes for urb 0
[ 3031.073777] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 509 bytes for urb 1
[ 3031.220068] ch348 ttyUSB6: UART_IIR_THRI - unknown byte: 0x00
[ 3031.220697] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 509 bytes for urb 0
[ 3031.221342] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 509 bytes for urb 1
[ 3031.512113] ch348 ttyUSB6: UART_IIR_THRI - unknown byte: 0x00
[ 3031.512795] ch348 ttyUSB6: submitted 12 bytes for urb 0
[ 3031.513359] ch348 ttyUSB7: submitted 5 bytes for urb 0
[ 3031.513859] ch348 ttyUSB7: UART_IIR_THRI - unknown byte: 0x00
[ 3031.530476] ch348 ttyUSB6: UART_IIR_THRI - unknown byte: 0x00
However, the receiving end sees different data (at around byte 513-518
in my tests) than we wanted to send.

My general flow is:
- check if we have received THRE - if not: don't transmit more data on this=
 port
- submit up to two URBs with up to 512 - 3 (CH348_TX_HDRSIZE) bytes to
not exceed the HW TX FIFO size of 1024 bytes (page 1 in the datasheet)
if the kfifo has enough data

If you want me to test something else then please let me know and I'll try =
it.
Otherwise I'll not dig much deeper, given the fact that I don't know
how the firmware works (e.g. in which order they send the status to
the host and what kind of state they hold internally) and we can still
optimize this later.

Sure, try the direct link [1] - and if it doesn't work try [2].
It doesn't document any registers, so it's a high-level datasheet -
nor a programmers handbook.

Thank you for the pointers. For today I -ETIMEDOUT, I'll take a look
at these in the next few days.
