Nice to see a monochrome implementation, I actually planned to remove
the R1 format from v3 since the gadget driver doesn't implement it.
Having unused (and poorly tested) code isn't that great, but I forgot.
It turns out it was a good thing that I forgot that :-)

Yeah I figured always having full updates might benefit/simplify
monochrome devices, but I'd wait for an actual device needing it before
adding it. Now that you need it, I'll add a flag for it in the next
version.

I would like to keep the SET_BUFFER request since it will serve as a
syncing point between the host and the device. I'm no USB expert but I
assume that a bulk transfer can fail halfway through and result in the
next update starting where the previous one failed and thus writing
beyond the end of the display buffer.
