In the future people will want to make other changes to 
include/linux/usb.h and they will not be aware that those changes will 
adversely affect usbip, because there is no documentation saying that 
the values defined in usb.h are part of a user API.  That will be a 
problem, because those changes may be serious and important ones, not 
just decorative or stylistic as in this case.

I agree with Hongren that values defined in include/linux/ should not be 
part of a user API.  There are two choices:

	Move the definitions into include/uapi/linux/, or

	Add code to translate the values between the numbers used in 
	userspace and the numbers used in the kernel.  (This is what
	was done for urb->transfer_flags in devio.c:proc_do_submiturb() 
	near line 1862.)
