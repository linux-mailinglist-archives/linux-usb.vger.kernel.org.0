Can you include specific models here in case we revisit this or find a
generic solution that needs to be tested to make sure we don't regress
these platforms?

Maybe a bugzilla with complete "lspci -vvnn" and dmesg logs?

IIUC, we're doing a D3cold-to-D0 transition in this path:

  pci_pm_default_resume_early
    pci_power_up
      platform_pci_set_power_state(PCI_D0)    # turn on via ACPI
      pci_raw_set_power_state(PCI_D0)
        pci_read_config_word(dev, dev->pm_cap + PCI_PM_CTRL, &pmcsr)
        # pmcsr says device is in D3hot
        pci_write_config_word(dev, dev->pm_cap + PCI_PM_CTRL, pmcsr)
        # sets to D0
        pci_dev_d3_sleep                      # <-- need more time here

I would sort of expect that ACPI would be putting the device in D0,
not leaving it in D3hot, but maybe that's just my ignorance.

In any case, I think you need more time after writing PCI_PM_CTRL to
transition from D3hot to D0.  Right?

This delay is for a D3hot -> D0 transition, right?  Can you make the
message say "D3hot" explicitly?  And maybe include "d3hot" in the
function name as well?

This is a nice bit of refactoring; could you split it into a separate
patch that only does the refactor, followed by another that adds the
Ryzen quirk?
