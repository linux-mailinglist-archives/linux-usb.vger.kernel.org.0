Hi Alan,

thanks for taking time to review!

Ok, I'll try to come up with a better description.

Yes, that is the assumption, although you have a point that this isn't
necessarily the case. It's probably true in the vast majority of cases,
but a hub could be wired up to multiple controllers. I'll change the
loop to set the flag without breaking, it's a micro-optimization
anyway.

Ok, less cumbersome code is always good :)

The motivation of the explicit kfree was to avoid hogging memory if the
USB device disappears and reappears repeatedly. However this doesn't seem
to be a very common scenario so maybe we can ignore it.

Ack, thanks for catching!

True, the dangling references aren't a good idea. Initially I thought
that the USB devices holding a reference of the hub device would prevent
this, but apparently that was wishful thinking. IIUC unbinding would be
done through device_driver_detach().

Ok, will abort if the function returns an error.

In this case it's probably better to change the return type to void, since
there is not really an alternative course of action.

Yes, implicitly, of_find_device_by_node() "takes a reference to the
embedded struct device which needs to be dropped after use."
