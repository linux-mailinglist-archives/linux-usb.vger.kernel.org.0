Hi Alan,

I hava a IcyBox IB-3740-C31 [0], this device seems to be identical to the one
here. It has the same USB IDs and case design.
It also has the serial number "4".
The only difference it seems is the field bcdDevice which is "1.36" and the
reported name is different (see the patch below).

So I adapted the patch slightly to also match that bcdDevice.
I also changed the productName field but that does not seem to be used anyways.

Using the quirk flags "fgkm" as mentioned in [1] did not help.

FYI while there are many reports that UAS does not work with these devices,
there also are a few that report it working. For example [2].

This is the exact issue:
