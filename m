The primary reason for this restriction (as far as I'm aware) is because 
the routine uses spin_lock/spin_unlock rather than the 
_irqsave/_irqrestore variants.  There's also a small efficiency issue: 
In the vast majority of cases involving real host controllers, the 
routine _will_ be called in interrupt context.  So we optimized for that 
case.

It's a bug in USB/IP.  Interrupts should be disabled when it calls 
usb_hcd_giveback_urb().
