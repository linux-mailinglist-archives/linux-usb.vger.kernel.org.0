That patch has gone under my radar.

Why do we have to care about this kind of stuff in the drivers? It
sounds like something that only affects DT platforms, so why isn't
this being fixed in the DT core code?

I didn't have time to study this fw_deflink thing yet, it is
completely new to me and unfortunately I'm going on vacation now, but
it looks like something that has been added to the driver core in a
haste without enough thinking, and which is now causing problems. Not
cool.
