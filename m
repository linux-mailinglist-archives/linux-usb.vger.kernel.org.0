Correct.

At least historically.  I have cleaned things up so no on native
we can do a byte by byte copy.  But for the compat case we still
copy field by field so that we have a chance of translating the fields.

That logic will work yes.  That is essentially what I implemented in
proc_submiturb_compat:
	userurb_sigval.sival_int = ptr_to_compat(arg);

The practical problem is that we only know the compat status
of userspace when (a) the usb ioctl is called and when (b) the signal is
delivered to userspace.  We can't fix this a (b) because there is
too little information available due to the fact that glibc also
uses SI_ASYNCIO but with si_uid, si_pid, and si_siginfo. So we can't
just replace si_pid with sinfo->si_addr because si_pid and si_uid are
valid.

So we have to do something at (a) which is complicated by the fact
that we don't have siginfo yet.  So I choose to store a sigval_t
instead to just get the relevant bits.

Welcome.  I am trying to make this stuff comprehensible.
