No, the bug is not in the USB subsystem.  Drivers are not supposed to 
call usb_set_interface() unless they can guarantee that the device will 
not be removed while the call is in progress, generally by holding the 
device lock.

I suppose it could be considered a bug that this requirement is not 
documented at the start of the function.  You could submit a patch 
adding an appropriate section to the kerneldoc.

Here you see usb_set_interface() called from the UVC driver under 
inappropriate circumstances.  To fix the problem it will be necessary 
to fix the UVC driver.  It should not allow itself to be unbound from 
the device while a user-driven operation, such as 
uvc_video_start_transfer(), is in progress.
