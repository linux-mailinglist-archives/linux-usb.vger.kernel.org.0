Ok, I'll do that.

I've no idea. I don't have any datasheets from this device.

As John Stultz didn't re-submit this one (and looking at the DT
between Kirin 960 and 970 from the original Kernel 4.9 official
drivers), I suspect that only Kirin 970 requires this quirk.

It could well be due to some Dwc3 revision, but it could also be due
to some differences at the USB part of the SoC, as there are a
few other things different between hikey 960 and 970: it has a
different PHY driver, and there are also some differences at the
USB HUB which is connected into it.

On both devices, the USB physical ports are actually connected
into a HUB. In the case of Hikey 970, the hub seems to be a
TI TUSB8041 4-Port Hub:

Again, no idea. I didn't actually tried to suspend/resume.

Maybe the original author can shed a light on it.

Thanks,
Mauro
