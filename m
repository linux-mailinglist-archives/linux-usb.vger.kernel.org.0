I'm curious if this was ever resolved. I just ran into this exact issue
with Android ADB which uses 16KB buffers, along with f_fs supporting
S/G since 5.0, combined with our IOMMU which performs this merging
behavior, so it resulted in a single TRB getting queued with CHN=1 and
LST=0 and thus the transfer never completes. Your initial patch resolves
the issue for me, but upon revisiting this discussion I couldn't tell if
you had attempted to patch DMA API instead as per Felipe's suggestion.

Thanks,
Jack
