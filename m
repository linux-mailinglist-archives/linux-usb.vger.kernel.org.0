Documentation is hard :)

Can you think of some wording here that would explain this better?
Something like "after you call this, you can't touch the pointer you
passed into here" is what I'm going for.

I guess the documentation for device_destroy() would work here as well,
which says:

	 * This call unregisters and cleans up a device that was created with a
	 * call to device_create().

Would that be better?
