I was directly referring to your "Yeah, why future proof it now, ..."
remark here. But more in general I personally find the tone of your
emails in this thread somewhat "combative".

I believe that in the end we all want the same thing which is to help
Linux users to get the best experience possible. It just seems that we
disagree on how to reach that goal.

Assuming that I have that correct, then I believe that there is a lot
of common ground between us; and I wish that we could approach this
in a way where we try to find a solution which we can all agree on.

Ideally we could just wave a magic wand and make this all work,
but unfortunately reality is not cooperating, so we need to come up
with some pragmatic solution here.

That is a very interesting link thank you. That certainly advocates
for a generic approach introducing a new US_FL_ATA_1X_OK and then
adding quirks setting that for both your model and the 4 models
listed there.

I would really appreciate it if you could submit a patch series
for this. But if you don't want to do that then I'll put this on
my own TODO list.

Thank you, that is another interesting link. Note that the page does
acknowledge that the problem with Seagate enclosures is real and
that in many cases the choice is falling back to usb-storage support
with working ATA pass-through, or UAS without ATA pass-through.

Given the huge performance advantages of UAS, especially with SSDs,
IMHO it is better to go with UAS in this case. But I guess in some
scenarios SMART support may be more important then UAS support.

I'll contact the author of that wiki page to discuss this further
with him and see if he has any good ideas for this problem.

I've taken a quick peek at this and I see that you've also restored
the old per model quirks to disable ATA pass-through on known to be
broken models, good.

Note that the list of broken models which you've added it missing the
0xab25 and 0xab38 product-ids which according to:
https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_USB-Devices
have broken ATA passthrough support with UAS.

If I assume that these behave as some of the other Seagate drivers and
the bridge-chip crashes when trying to use ATA pass-through, then once
these changes hit your users and customers you have just broken usage
of those disks together with your product. This nicely illustrates
why we don't want to make this change in the mainline kernel.

Note depending on how important disk performance is for you
an alternative approach might be to modify the Seagate product-id check
to simply disable UAS on Seagate devices, that would be a lot safer.

Regards,

Hans
