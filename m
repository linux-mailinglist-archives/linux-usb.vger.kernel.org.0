Hi Greg,

As Felipe mentioned, we need to make sure that this TX FIFO resize logic
is carefully thought out, since the behavior could be different based
off the HW configuration as shown in the past.  Eventually, I hope that
this does get applied, but I think the changes needs more detailed
reviews, as there may be potential shortfalls I did not consider due to
my limited knowledge of what happened w/ the previous logic.  That's
pretty much the reason for tagging it as a RFC, since we still need to
hash out if this is the right approach.

Thanks!
