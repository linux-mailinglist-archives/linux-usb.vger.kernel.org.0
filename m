I agree that if we can remove the ACPI hacks in here, we should try do
so (e.g. given that no one really uses it anymore).

As Andrew already mentioned, that is a separate issue not directly
related to this series, though.

Removing it before reworking the dwc3 binding [1] and adding multiport
support [2] should simplify both of those series quite a bit, however.
