Yes, I believe so.

Yes, it can be set to 'true' by default for all devices.

It doesn't need to be before ->prepare, it can be before ->suspend (as it
is now).

IMO it can be simpler even.

Because power.may_skip_resume is taken into account along with
MAY_SKIP_RESUME and the driver setting the latter must be prepared
for skipping its resume callbacks regardless of the suspend side of
things, they may always be skipped (and the device may be left in
suspend accordingly) if there is a reason to avoid doing that.

The core doesn't know about those reasons, so it has no reason to
touch power.may_skip_resume after setting it at the outset and then
whoever sees a reason why these callbacks should run (the subsystem
or the driver) needs to clear power.may_skip_resume (and clearing it
more than once obviously makes no difference).

Indeed.

That has been the case forever, though.

Because the core has not been calling pm_runtime_resume() during system-wide
suspend for devices with SMART_SUSPEND clear, that should not be changed or
we'll see regressions.

I know for a fact that some drivers expect the core to be doing nothing
with respect to that.

Again, anything like that would change the current behavior which may
not be expected by at least some drivers, so I wouldn't change that.

IOW, SMART_SUSPEND clear means to the core that *it* need not care about
the suspend side at all (because somebody else will do that).
