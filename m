Before the patch you sent in yesterday, usbmon reported these requests
as directed to device number 1 (which is the number assigned to root
hubs since they are the first devices registered on their USB buses),
not 0.

With the change you made, things aren't so simple any more.  The kernel 
does not control the addresses assigned by the xHCI controller, and 
there's no guarantee that the controller won't use all the addresses 
from 1 to 127 for plugged-in devices, leaving no number available to 
represent the root hub.

How about using address 255 in the usbmon output to represent root
hubs?  That wouldn't require any format change at all.

By the way, there is one bad aspect to your patch.  Although the device
addresses output by usbmon will now correspond exactly to the physical
addresses on the bus, they will not correspond to the device numbers
used everywhere else in the kernel.  For example, someone monitoring
communcations with /dev/bus/usb/001/005 won't know what device address
to look for in the usbmon output -- it might not be 005.
