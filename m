These Kconfig changes are causing the resulting .config to be different.
For example, if I start with omap2plus_defconfig, the resulting .config
before and after your series is different as shown below

:/work/linux$ diff /tmp/.config .config
1902d1901
< # CONFIG_HISI_HIKEY_USB is not set
4992c4991
< CONFIG_USB_XHCI_PLATFORM=m
---
> # CONFIG_USB_XHCI_PLATFORM is not set
5073,5075c5072
< # CONFIG_USB_DWC3_HOST is not set
< # CONFIG_USB_DWC3_GADGET is not set
< CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE=y
---
> CONFIG_USB_DWC3_GADGET=y
5173a5171
> # CONFIG_USB_ONBOARD_HUB is not set
5285c5283
< CONFIG_USB_ROLE_SWITCH=m
---
> # CONFIG_USB_ROLE_SWITCH is not set

I would expect the same issues for multi_v7_defconfig and multi_v8_defconfig as well.
I'm ok to update the relevant defconfigs files so that the resulting .config is identical to
before your series. Thanks!
