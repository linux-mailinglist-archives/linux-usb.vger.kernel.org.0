Hmm. I took at closer look at the parport code and it seems the current
implementation is already racy but that removing the tasklet is going to
widen that that window.

Those register writes in restore() should be submitted before any
later requests. Perhaps setting a flag and flushing the work in
parport_prologue() could work?

On the other hand, the restore() implementation looks broken in that it
doesn't actually restore the provided state. I'll go fix that up.
