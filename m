The patch[1] adding that is posted to the list and may not have landed yet.

Whether the RT1711H TypeC driver handles it or not is not a binding problem.

Let me put it this way. The gpio property belongs wherever the mux is
represented. In this case, I would expect the graph port representing
the HS port to have 2 endpoints representing the 2 mux outputs. We
don't generally put properties in the endpoint or port nodes, but the
parent nodes.

Yes, bindings/usb/usb-device.txt.
