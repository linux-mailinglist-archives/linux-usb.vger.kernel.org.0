Ah yes, of course there=E2=80=99s plenty of things but this is =
specifically about
USB. I worked on a few of those so I'm not denying them, I guess I =
should have
written this more clearly :)

I=E2=80=99ve also been told the same about media drivers. For example, =
someone
trying to write a USB media driver stares at work needed to just _start_ =
doing
what they had initially planned and simply gives up. It creates a =
scenario
where people continuously wait on each other to do the "heavy work", =
i.e.: to
come up with the common code/abstractions.

So far I see a pattern where sample drivers count as users. This has =
been the
case, for example, for rust_dma.rs. I was under the impression that the =
same
would apply here. Although I do realize that there were plans for dma =
code
other than rust_dma.rs, of course.

As for Nova and Tyr, these are projects with a lot of big companies =
involved.

They were able to break this chicken and egg situation in part due to =
that,
because companies were willing to allocate engineers for both the =
drivers _and_
the required infrastructure. Unless the same can be said for USB, media =
or any
other subsystems, I don't see it happening. Also, even if there is a =
company
interested, smaller ones are not willing to work on the infrastructure =
either,
only on the actual end results (i.e.: drivers).

That's just my humble opinion, of course.
