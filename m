Drivers are not consistent in the way they handle these errors, as you 
have seen.  A few try to take active measures, such as retrys with 
increasing timeouts.  Many drivers just ignore them, which is not a very 
good idea.

The general feeling among kernel USB developers is that a -EPROTO, 
-EILSEQ, or -ETIME error should be regarded as fatal, much the same as 
an unplug event.  The driver should avoid resubmitting URBs and just 
wait to be unbound from the device.

If you would like to audit drivers and fix them up to behave this way, 
that would be great.

(FYI, by far the most common causes of these errors are: The user has 
unplugged the USB cable, or the device's firmware has crashed.  It is 
quite rare for the cause to be intermittent, although not entirely 
unheard of -- for example, someone once reported errors resulting from 
EM or power-line interference caused by flickering fluorescent lights or 
something of that sort.  It's pretty safe to ignore this possibility.)
