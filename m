Even I am not sure why it should use this variable to check, that's why
I thought of asking in the mailing list. If the maintainers agree that
we can remove this variable I can send a patch doing it. This variable
is not used for any other purpose in the module, so removing it
shouldn't be a problem.

If the variable u132_exiting is really used for the purpose of checking
if the module is exiting then there might be a problem. If at all it is
assumed that exit never races with probe function and it is always
called after probe finishes or something, then this variable is not even
required. And suppose there is possibility of a race condition then only
holding the mutex in exit but not probe does not make sense.

I do not know much about this module so I cannot answer this.
From the point of synchronization, this list is initialized in init and
then only used in probe and exit function. And lock is only held in
probe, if at all it is assumed that exit cannot race with probe, there
is no need to use the mutex.

Yes, I checked out a few others and I could not see any usage of such
variable to check if module is exiting.
