Thanks, I'll include that in the next version.

The vendor driver:
- first acquires a per-device (not per port) write_lock [0]
- then waits for the (per-device, not per port) write buffer to be empty [1=
]
- and only then submits more data to be transmitted [2]

I have not tried this yet but if still relevant (after the info about
the THRE interrupt) then I can try it and share the results.

I cannot find any other usb-serial driver which uses this pattern.
Most devices seem to be happy to take more data once they trigger the
write_bulk_callback but not ch348.

If there's any other (even if it's not a usb-serial) driver that I can
use as a reference implementation for your suggestion?
I'm not sure whether to use a dedicated kthread, single threaded workqueue,=

Thanks for the hint - I have tried this and it indeed simplifies the code!
