Still, the patches need more work (see my replies to the relevant patches).

If I were you, I'd split this series into 3 parts.

The first part would be the addition of PMSG_POWEROFF just for
hibernation, which should not be objectionable (the first 4 patches
above).

The next one would be changes to allow PCI bridges to go into
D3hot/cold during the last stage of hibernation (the "power-off"
transition).  This can be justified by itself even before starting to
use the same power-off flow for the last stage of hibernation and for
system power-down.

The last one would be the hibernation/power-down integration.

Each of the above can be posted separately and arguably you need to
get the first part in before the other two and the second part in
before the third one, preferably not in the same cycle.

This way, if there are any regressions in the first two parts, there
will be at least some time to address them before the last part goes
in.

Thanks!
