OK, just did a resume after suspended (for an hour, which somehow seems 
to matter) while my CalDigit dock was attached with the ASMedia NVMe 
adaptor at suspend, but both disconnected on resume, and I am indeed 
locked up.

I can attached the "pstore" report if necessary.

Unfortunately I won't be able to get back to the CalDigit until Saturday 
afternoon California time.

I'll be trying all the reverts/commits listed herein and at least check 
for regressions in other cases, though.
