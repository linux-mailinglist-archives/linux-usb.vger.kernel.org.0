Sigh.  The bug which prompted this whole thread was when I forgot to 
set the runtime PM status back to "active" in one of my drivers.  I was 
hoping the core could handle it for me automatically.

I guess the answer is always to set the SMART_SUSPEND flag.

Yes, your change to dev_pm_skip_resume() will prevent the problem from 
arising.

Okay, I'll check it out.

By the way, if you don't mind I may want to do some editing of 
devices.rst.
