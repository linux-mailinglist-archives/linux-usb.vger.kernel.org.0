That's intentional, I see no point in recreating uapi values that won't
change:

Linux errno: /include/uapi/asm-generic/errno{-base,}.h
Pixel formats: include/uapi/drm/drm_fourcc.h
Connector types and status: include/uapi/drm/drm_mode.h

The reason for exposing this is that the Linux gadget driver needs to
decompress the transfer into a buffer and the host needs to know how big
this is (the host can choose to lower this if it can't allocate a
continuous buffer of this size).

lz4 (in the kernel) is block compression and can't be used for
decompressing just a stream of bytes. There is a lz4 frame protocol
which looks like it could be useful, but it's not available in the
kernel. I hardly know anything about compression so I'm in no position
to add that to the kernel. Maybe someone will add it at a later time if
it is useful.

My plan was to remove R1 support from this version of the patchset, but
I forgot. The reason is that it's cumbersome to test when the gadget
driver doesn't support it. I had some code to test the implementation
when I made it, but it's removed now. It's very easy to add R1 back in
when there's a display that makes use of it giving it a thorough testing.

You mention further down that you have use cases for this, do you have a
timeplan for when you will make use of R1?

Do they hand out pid's? To me it's no big deal, it can be added later if

Indeed. This is a USB interface driver though, so it only looks at
vendor class interfaces. Then it checks if there's a bulk out endpoint,
if not it returns -ENXIO and the device subsytem moves on to another
interface driver if any. Next it tries to fetch the display descriptor
and if not succesful it returns -ENODEV to give another driver a chance.

I have tried my best to let the driver tolerate other vendor class
interfaces on the device.

Not sure what you mean here, this is an interface driver.

There exists a HID Display page:

Request #: HUTRR29
Title: Repurposing the Alphanumeric Display Page (0x14) as a generic
Auxiliary Display Page and adding bitmap and custom segment
capabilities
https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/hutrr29b_0.pdf

I couldn't find anything that uses it. It could have been interesting if
there was a bulk endpoint here.

I don't understand why PID should not be necessary, I'm using a vendor
class interface and the driver can't probe all of those, so it has to
look at specific vid:pid's.

I have tried together with a HID interface and that worked. I
specifically want HID to work so it's possible to make touch displays.
The Raspberry Pi images I've made available for testing has a console on
a USB ACM (serial) interface.

usb_interface has a pointer to usb_device and that's what's used to send
usb messages, so instead of dereferencing each time I just use it directly.

I liked that it is well defined and understood, so I didn't have to be
clever. It's nice that the size is embedded for future versions of the
protocol that migh expand the descriptor. Well not so important now that
I have the version number in there.

I like it and think I'll keep it, so I'll change the macro:

#define GUD_DRM_USB_DT_DISPLAY 0x44

Actually it is:

	u8 requesttype = USB_TYPE_VENDOR | USB_RECIP_INTERFACE;

see gud_drm_usb_control_msg(). I could add
GUD_DRM_USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR instead of using USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR
if that makes it any clearer.

For read requests the device is stalling in case of error and the host
issues a status request.

For write requests the only thing I've found is a way to delay the
status stage, but only for requests without payload:

drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c: composite_setup():

} else if (value == USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS && w_length != 0) {
	WARN(cdev,
		"%s: Delayed status not supported for w_length != 0",
		__func__);
}

And I can't stall, only continue:

/**
 * usb_composite_setup_continue() - Continue with the control transfer
 * @cdev: the composite device who's control transfer was kept waiting
 *
 * This function must be called by the USB function driver to continue
 * with the control transfer's data/status stage in case it had requested to
 * delay the data/status stages. A USB function's setup handler (e.g.
set_alt())
 * can request the composite framework to delay the setup request's
data/status
 * stages by returning USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS.
 */
void usb_composite_setup_continue(struct usb_composite_dev *cdev)

If I could control the status stage and stall after data was received,
then I wouldn't need my own status stage.

It stops responding to requests.

I don't know why it doesn't respond, it could be a controller driver
(dwc2) bug, but I'm no expert here. Actually this is the first work I've
ever done with USB.

I couldn't find interrupt ep used in drivers/usb/class/usblp.c, but I've
seen examples of this used for status.
I'm a bit wary of using more endpoints since I suspect that
microcontrollers don't have that many.

I did a test setting delay to fixed 500-1500 usec in the polling loop
instead of the 4500-5500 that will be used when running a movie.
Actual frames per second for a 30 sec movie clip changed from 8.8 to
9.0, so latency isn't a big issue at least.

I also realise now that I don't need the PENDING flag, I can just keep
stalling the status request until the device is done.

Not excatly, but I can try rather vaguely :-) The memory subsystem is a
black box to me. It has to do with the memory page attribute that
controls how memory access is handled by the CPU cache. The default for
shmem is WriteCombined which makes for slow read access on ARM, but on
x86 there doesn't seem to be any penalty judging by my brief testing.
The black lines are probably cache lines that haven't been
flushed/invalidated or whatever the black box does.

It returns -EPIPE, but as mentioned above, I can't stall a control write
request with payload. So I need my own status stage.

Ideally I would have written a spec and made the implementation against
it. However since I suck at writing, I even struggle with getting the
compiler to understand me, so it won't happen. It would have taken me
forever.

Indeed, the most important one. All the other paths can take "as long"

GUD_DRM_USB_REQ_SET_BUFFER serves one purpose in addition to sending the
header, as mentioned in the comment preceeding it, it waits for any
ongoing decompression/copying on the device from the previous fb flush.
lz4 decompression is much faster than compression, but the host will be
much more powerful than the device, so the host will almost always have
to wait for the device when flushing continously.

Yes you're right, the overhead is insignificant for FHD, 4-500 usec for
the actual control messages (including status message) vs. 50-100ms for
the total operation (depending on how well it compresses).

But why should this overhead be of concern for a display that has a
framebuffer transfer of 4-8kB? It will be more than fast enough.

For display adapters it makes sense especially when it has more than one
connector like the Raspberry Pi which has an hdmi and a sdtv connector.
For display panels the connector is USB yes, but there's no type for
this yet. There's a discussion going on if we should stop adding
connector types for panels and just add a DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_PANEL type.
Not sure if there has been a conclusion on this.

If that status can change, the device has to set
gud_drm_gadget_connector.flags |= GUD_DRM_CONNECTOR_FLAGS_POLL.
Now the host will poll the status every 10 seconds. Userspace is
notified about change in status.

I can drop the word internal if it confuses, but any non-Linux
