How did you distinguish them before this change? It has nothing really
related with the patch in topic.

No, it's not the only way you have. I say it was the easiest way for
you to find a corresponding device. The DT-node name never was a part
of ABI for at least up until we finally get the DT-node names
consistent with DT spec. Only then it would be possible to consider
them as such. One more time I'll quote what @Krzisztof has already
told you twice:

First time he sent a possible solution for the problem:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201221210423.GA2504@kozik-lap/

To sum up you could have used one of the more portable approaches
1. add an udc alias to the controller and use it then to refer to the
corresponding USB controller
2. search through DT-nodes looking for a specific compatible/reg
DT-properties.

Of course it was easier to revert the patch. But if we always chose
such approach, the kernel would have been filled with tons of
workarounds and legacy parts without possibility to move forward to
having more unified interfaces.

Well, @Krzisztof has already given you such suggestions regarding this
issue not once. But you tend to ignore them.

Anyway this patch doesn't break LTS kernel and doesn't break the
linux-firmware either. It changes DT-node name, which happens to
change the device name, which isn't guaranteed to be stable as it's
not part of the kernel ABI. If you think otherwise please provide some
proves to that. I didn't find any in the official Linux ABI docs.
