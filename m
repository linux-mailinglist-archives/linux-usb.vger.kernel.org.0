That abort happens at offset 4d00, here is part of objdump:

        if (!arch_irqs_disabled_flags(flags))
    4ccc:       340014a0        cbz     w0, 4f60 <xhci_irq+0x2d0>

    4cf4:       35002741        cbnz    w1, 51dc <xhci_irq+0x54c>
        status = readl(&xhci->op_regs->status);
    4cf8:       f9400f41        ldr     x1, [x26, #24]

    4d00:       b9400021        ldr     w1, [x1]

So it looks like it is that MMIO access, right?

This makes sense. Good catch lso with fact that it is from threaded
context!

No :-( I read all documentation which is available for this PCIe
controller, part of Marvell A3720 SoC and I have not found anything
which allows me to configure raising external aborts.

I already figured out that CPU receive external abort also when trying
to issue a new PIO transfer for accessing PCI config space while
previous transfer has not finished yet. And also there is no way (at
least in documentation) which allows to "mask" this external abort. But
this issue can be fixed in pci-aardvark.c driver to disallow access to
config space while previous transfer is still running (I will send patch
for this one).

So seems that PCIe controller HW triggers these external aborts when
device on PCIe bus is not accessible anymore.

If this issue is really caused by MMIO access from xhci driver when
device is not accessible on the bus anymore, can we do something to
prevent this kernel crash? Somehow mask that external abort in kernel
for a time during MMIO access?
