You're right. Although the actual behavior of the hosts is not different
from what I wrote - they really just ignore out endpoint.
I will eventually fix this in the patch description.

Thank you, this is a typo. With the replacement of the word, the meaning
is fixed. They really don't work. Hosts do not use OUT endpoint
and transmit reports.

Yep. They see OUT endpoint and refuse to use the device in various ways,
for example, they don't continue the initialization process after receiving
the descriptor. The failure behavior may differ, but it always leads to
a refuse or to the fact that the device simply does not poll IN endpoint.

Exactly. Hosts will either stop the initialization process when they receive
a handle with an OUT endpoint, or they will not be able to work in any other way.

While investigating the problem with Apple, I realized that their UEFI
is presumably iterated over endpoints and simply does not break the loop
when an IN endpoint is detected. They reach OUT endpoint (which follows IN),
see that it is not IN endpoint, repeat the last initialization ops three times
(SET_IDLE, etc.) and refuse to work with our keyboard. If I change the order
of the endpoints in the descriptor and do OUT first and then IN, then everything
will work in the case of Apple, but this is obviously a violation of the standard,
since it explicitly describes the order of IN and then the optional OUT.

And it only helps with Apple. So the correct solution was to make SETUP/SET_REPORT
because this satisfies all devices. For the order of the endpoints, see 7.2 of HID 1.11:

Previously, this was the case, but then this functionality was removed
for two reasons: using OUT endpoint takes up a USB channel less than SETUP
and allows you to transfer more data from HID gadget, and also allows you
to organize a queue. The queue could have been organized without this change,
but the first point is more significant. I found the correspondence
so that you can read the history of the issue, link below.

That change was not a problem as long as f_hid was mainly used for the keyboard
at the OS level. Now I am making an open source KVM-over-IP based on this
and the compatibility hell have risen to full height.

Sorry, I couldn't find this on lore.kernel.org. Maybe I didn't search well,
or this correspondence is too old, 2012.
