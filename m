After switching from host -> device -> host the usb0 device as seen by 
ifconfig remains "RUNNING" and in the routing table.

FYI This is the regression.

Also /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:11.0/dwc3.0.auto/gadget.0/net is 
still missing.

After deeper diving into v6.1.0, I found the latter a longer existing 
bug, not caused by your patch.

More over, this doesn't seem to do any harm.

The first issue does, as we try to route traffic over a device that no 
longer exists.
