Adding suspend_late would be a little painful.  But you don't really 
need it; you just need to make the "master" hub wait for its peer to 
suspend, which is easy to do.

And hubs would need to know their peers in any case, because you have to 
check if any devices attached to the peer have wakeup enabled.

It wouldn't hurt to have that property anyway.  The determination of 
peer ports doesn't always work right, because it depends on information 
provided by the firmware and that information isn't always correct.
