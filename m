I'm suggesting you keep the fallback in the driver.  It does no harm,
and it's contained in one place.

On the dts side, you're adding the new phys property without removing
the old-style nodes at first.  If you put the driver change first, the
dts could be switched to the new style in one patch without a confusing
hybrid ever existing.

You can't possibly know what's out there.  Besides, isn't the general
policy to not break compatibility without a very good reason?
