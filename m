I thought of one more potential downside to one-psy-per-pdo:

Remember that a source or sink's Capabilities may dynamically change without
a port disconnect, and this could make one-psy-per-pdo much more chatty with
power supply deletions and re-registrations on load balancing events.

At basically any time, a power source may send a new SRC_CAP to the sink wh=
ich
adjusts, deletes, or adds to the list of PDOs, without the connection state
machine registering a disconnect.

In a real world case, I have a charger in my kitchen that has 2 USB-C ports
and supports a total of 30W output. When one device is plugged in:
5V 3A, 9V 3A, 15V 2A
However, when two devices are plugged in, each sees:
5V 3A

The load balancing event would result in two power supply deletions, whereas
if it were a single psy per power supply (incorporating the list of PDO cho=
ices)
it would just be a single PROP_CHANGED event.

It seems cleaner to me to have deletions and additions only possible when t=
he
thing is unplugged or plugged.

Thanks,
Benson
