I agree that the hardware representation isn't totally straightforward, however
the description isn't limited to Linux:

- there is a single IC (like the Realtek RTS5411)
- the IC may require several resources to be initialized in a certain way
  - this may require executing hardware specific code by some driver, which
    isn't a USB device driver
- the IC can 'contain' multiple USB hub devices, which can be connected to
  separate USB busses
- the IC doesn't have a control bus, which somewhat resembles the
  'simple-audio-amplifier' driver, which also registers a platform device
  to initialize its resources

- to provide the functionality of powering down the hub conditionally during
  system suspend the driver (whether it's a platform driver or something else)
  needs know which USB (hub) devices correspond to it. This is a real world
  problem, on hardware that might see wide distribution.

There were several attempts to solve this problem in the past, but none of them
was accepted. So far Alan Stern seems to think the driver (not necessarily the
binding as is) is a suitable solution, Greg KH also spent time reviewing it,
without raising conceptual concerns. So it seems we have solution that would
be generally landable from the USB side.

I understand that your goal is to keep the device tree sane, which I'm sure
can be challenging. If you really can't be convinced that the binding might
be acceptable in its current or similiar form then please offer guidance
on possible alternatives which allow to achieve the same functionality.

Thanks

Matthias
