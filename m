Hi Greg,

So, I've tried to use pre-existing mechanisms there in the USB core, but
they are not populated correctly at the time of function binding.  I
will highlight some of the things I've tried, and why they do not work.
 If possible, if you could point which core functions can achieve what
we are trying to do here, that would help as well.

  - f->endpoints - This is a bitmap which carries the endpoints used by
a particular function driver.  This does not work, as this is set during
receiving the SET_CONFIG packet.  (we need this during the function
driver binding stage)

  - gadget->in_epnum/gadget->out_epnum - This carries the count of
endpoints used per configuration.  This would be perfect, but this count
is only incremented when we are not matching EPs using the EP name.  So
in designs where the EP name is used to match, it can not be used.

 - gadget->ep_list - I can use this now in the check_config() to iterate
through the list of eps to see which ones have been claimed for a
particular configuration.

So just to re-iterate, the TXFIFO resize logic kicks in when the host
sends the SET_CONFIG packet, which is the "end" of USB enumeration.  We
had discussed a concern previously where, what if we run the resize
logic, and there is not enough internal memory.  We'd end up with an
enumerated device w/ certain functions broken.

This is where the check_config() comes into the picture.  It uses the
number of endpoints collected during the bind() stage, and checks to
make sure the resize logic can at least allocate 1 TXFIFO per endpoint.
 If it can not, then it will fail the bind sequence.

Thanks
