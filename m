Yes, it should.  More specifically, if the keyboard is capable of 
generating wakeup requests, and wakeup is enabled for both the keyboard 
device and the HC, then the keyboard should be able to wake up the 
system from suspend.  Some HCs or systems might not support this 
capability, however.

If the hardware/firmware can support it then it should work.  I don't 
know what's going on with your older Tegra SoCs; it's possible there is 
a bug in the driver.
