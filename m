Do not use extcon with the Type-C drivers unless you have some really
good reason for not using the dedicated frameworks for each thing. The
reason why we even have some of the dedicated frameworks in the first
place, for example the USB role switch class, is because extcon simply
could not be made to work on every type of hardware architecture.

So you will need to register a power supply in tps6598x.c just like
the other USB Type-C drivers like tcpm.c and ucsi.c if the TPS65982
does not communicated directly with the BQ25895. That can be one
of "supplied_from" (and also "supplied_to" if needed for sourcing) for
the bq25890_changer. You probable only need to implement the
external_power_changed() hook for it if it's missing in order to make
it work. You can also register a power supply in dwc3 and use it as a
second supply for bq25890 if you still really need to handle BC1.2.

The data role should already be handled for you. dwc3 already
registers an USB role switch, and tps6598x.c already configures one.
For data role you should not need any additional code.

Please note that there is also framework for the alt mode muxes.
