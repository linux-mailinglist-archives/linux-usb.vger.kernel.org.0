Along these lines, take a look at the book, Linux Device Drivers, third
edition, which is free online, as it has a chapter about USB drivers and
how they work.  That should help you out to understand the issues
involved with USB devices.

If you have specific questions after looking at that, and reading the
basic usb-skeleton.c driver in the kernel source tree, please let us
know!
