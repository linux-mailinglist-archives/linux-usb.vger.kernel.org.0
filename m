Don't bother with tcpm if you don't have PD support. Just register
your port(s) and the partners directly with the connector class:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/usb/typec.html

You can use the driver for the TI HD3SS3220 controller as an example
how to do that (drivers/usb/typec/hd3ss3220.c). That thing is also
just USB Type-C PHY without PD support just like your port controller.
