I doubt that will happen, and it's not something that I expect.  It's ok
to have platform-specific "sub-drivers" for common IP blocks, we do it
all the time.  But making it separate is good, much like has been done
for xhci as well.

Totally agreed, that's not ok.  But a different issue than what is
happening here.
