I have no preference either way, and can do that if that is more acceptable.

However I do think it makes sense to have the bus control whether this
attribute applies to it or not. Determining the first point in a
hierarchy of devices, where a device can be removed is highly bus
specific (set_usb_port_removable()).

AFAIK, the primary reason / use of this attribute was to distinguish
devices that can be removed by the user, and really all such devices
(at least the ones that matter to user) today sit either on PCI or USB
bus. We intend to use this attribute to segregate internal devices
from external devices, and collect some statistics about usb device
usage this way. There is also a VM case that I think Dmitry or Benson
on this thread can elaborate more about. There seem to be hundreds of
other bus types and I'm not sure if we want to unnecessarily flood the
sysfs with a removable attribute under each device.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Rajat
