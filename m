Yes; I double checked from a UART log all devices (now) went to correct 
state and from power measurement hardware the respective drop in power.

I will note I have a sampling bias of hardware being x86 AMD hardware.
Some of the testers of the series also tested Intel hardware which had 
similar power consumption problem, and I know there were improvements 
there too.

We probably will have to wait for linux-next for non-x86 hardware coverage.

I mean - if all goes well even a failed S4 flow should fall back to old 
path shutdown.  I *did contrive some failures* in an earlier version of 
the series and confirmed in the UART log it emitted the printk that it 
was falling back to shutdown.

I had two ideas that maybe could help for regression risk though:
1) I could add a shutdown= kernel parameter.  I'm not sure what words to 
use for the two paths but the idea would be if someone had a shutdown 
failure they could isolate if it's due to this by adding the parameter.

2) I could make a Documentation/ file explaining some examples how to 
get the shutdown log saved to pstore in case they don't have a UART 
available.
