In general we did not want to enable wakeup by default for mouse 
devices.  We didn't want to have a situation where somebody puts their 
computer to sleep and then accidentally moves the mouse, and that 
causes the computer to wake up.

I don't remember the reason why only keyboards supporting the boot 
protocol are enabled by default.  Maybe we thought those were likely to 
be the most reliable ones.

Sometimes supporting a device means _not_ enabling it for remote wakeup, 
because its wakeup support is broken.
