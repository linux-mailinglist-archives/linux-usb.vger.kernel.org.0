Depends how you interpret this. kstrtobool() uses one character (and
in some cases two) of the input. Everything else is garbage.
Should we interpret garbage?

I can agree with this.

Somehow cifs uses kstrtobool() in conjunction with the wider ranges. Nobody
complained so far. But maybe they had it from day 1.

So, we have two issues here: kstrtobool() doesn't report an error of
input when it has garbage, the user may rely on garbage to be
discarded.
