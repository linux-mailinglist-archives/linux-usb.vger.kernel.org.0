There's a few downsides to this approach (one psy for each pdo).

The PDOs returned by Source Capabilities and Sink Capabilities do not just
contain possible Voltage, Current, and Power combinations, but they also co=
ntain
additional information in the form of properties.

In the Fixed Supply PDO, the following bits convey information about the su=
pply
or sink (See USB PD Spec R3.1 V1.0 Table 6-9):

* B29 - Dual-Role Power
* B28 - USB Suspend Supported
* B27 - Unconstrained Power
* B26 - USB Communications Capable
* B25 - Dual-Role Data
* B24 - Unchunked Extended Messages Supported
* B23 - EPR Mode Capable

These bits exist in every single 32-bit Fixed Supply PDO, however,=20
Section 6.4.1.2.2 requires that they be appropriately set in the vSafe5V Fi=
xed
PDO (which is required for all sources and sinks), and set to 0 in all other
PDOs in the caps.

So, splitting out a particular port partner or port's PDOs into individual
power supplies runs the risk of the information above not properly being
attributed to the actual power supply.

For example, if you're connected to a 18W power supply that has a vSafe5V P=
DO,
and a 9V Fixed PDO, and you're operating at 18W, the 9V Fixed PDO will be A=
ctive
but the inactive vSafe5V PDO has information in those higher order bits that
remain relevant.

Just something to keep in mind.

I'm supportive of using a separate PSY to represent the different power rol=
es
of a particular port and port-partner, however. If you're connected to a US=
B-C
power bank, you should see two objects for that partner, one for when the
power bank is in source role, and one when the power bank is in sink role.

Even when you're in one role or the other, you should still be able to read
information from the other role in order to make an informed decision wheth=
er
you want to power role swap.

Thanks so much!
Benson
