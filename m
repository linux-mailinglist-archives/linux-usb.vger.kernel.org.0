No, no -- it won't work right if it's called in process context.  Not 
only do the spinlock calls leave the interrupt flag unchanged, also the 
driver callback routines may expect to be invoked with interrupts 
disabled.  (We have tried to fix this, but I'm not at all certain that 
all the cases have been updated.)
