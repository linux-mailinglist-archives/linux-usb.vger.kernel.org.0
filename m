It looks like your dmesg log was made without enabling debugging 
messages in usbcore.  Can you collect another log with debugging 
messages turned on?

	echo 'module usbcore =p' >/sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

Also, it might not hurt to collect and post a usbmon trace for a bad
suspend-resume cycle.
