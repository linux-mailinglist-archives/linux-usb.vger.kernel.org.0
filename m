That's not good.  There may not be a timeout; drivers expect transfers 
to complete with a failure, not to be retried indefinitely.

However, if you do know which endpoint/stream the error is connected to, 
you should be able to get the URB.  It will be the first one queued for 
that endpoint/stream.
