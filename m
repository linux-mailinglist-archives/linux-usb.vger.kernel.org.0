Please explain in detail how the enumeration of these Kingston flash
drives fails.  Or if such an explanation has already been posted,
please provide a link to it.

Come to think of it, the SHORT_NOT_OK flag is mainly used with HCDs
that don't have scatter-gather support.  Since your mausb driver does
support scatter-gather, you most likely won't encounter any problems 
unless you go looking for them specifically.

Where was the problem reported (URL to a mailing list archive)?  Who is
investigating it?

Thank you.
