Hello,

Thanks, this patch solves the issue, as one would expect.

However I'm under the impression that the underlying problem is only in 
the Event TRBs that arrive after the Event TRB of COMP_SHORT_PACKET 
type. In other words, the quirky behavior is only when the xHC flushes 
the Data TRBs that are left after the short packet has arrived, and 
sends faulty Event TRBs on their behalf.

So maybe ignore any Event TRB on behalf of a TD for which a 
COMP_SHORT_PACKET has been received? I mean, what information could it 
possibly contain?

This would also have solved the "Event TRB with no TDs queued" issue, 
just in a more generalized manner.

Regards,
    Eli
