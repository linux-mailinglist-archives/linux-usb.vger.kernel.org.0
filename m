Please, instead of sending the same incorrect patch over and over again, 
spend some time figuring out what is really going wrong.  I have already 
explained why this patch is not the right thing to do.

You have to determine why the poweroff callback in hcd-pci.c (which 
points to hcd_pci_suspend) isn't getting called.  That's the real 
explanation for your problem.
