Thanks for jumping in Ulf.

I was under the impression that the only such configuration we supported
was that we can explicitly attach and control multiple PDs from a
driver. I didn't think we could say that a given genpd is a subdomain of
multiple other genpds...

That said, it's better if we can ignore this, as it doesn't apply to our
problem at hand.

So to clarify, we have the following situation:

+---------------+
| CX            |
| +-----------+ |
| | USB_GDSC  | |
| | +-------+ | |
| | | dwc3  | | |
| | +-------+ | |
| +-----------+ |
+---------------+

CX can operate at different performance_states, USB_GDSC can be toggled
on/off and hence dwc3 needs CX to operate at a performance_state meeting
its needs.

The proposed patch is to list both CX and USB_GDSC as power-domains for
dwc3, in order for the required-opp in the dwc3 to affect CX.

I presume you're referring to the first half of
_genpd_set_performance_state(). This looks to be exactly what Stephen
and I discussed implementing.

I had a rather messy tree when I looked at this last time, presumably
missing something else to hide this propagation.


For the USB_GDSC we today don't describe that as a subdomain of CX, but
per your guidance and the recently introduced 3652265514f5 ("clk: qcom:
gdsc: enable optional power domain support") we should be fairly close
to the solution.


The one "problem" I can see is that I believe that some of the GDSCs in
GCC should be subdomains of MX, so the above referenced patch would then
need to be extended to allow specifying which of the multiple
power-domains each GDSC should be a subdomain of - something Dmitry and
I did discuss, but wasn't needed for the display GDSC.
Perhaps I'm just misinformed regarding this need though.

Given that Sandeep's proposed patch solves his problem without touching
the framework those patches (required-opps) must already have been
picked up.
