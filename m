Yes I can guarantee that currently this code (which is for the i915
driver only) only deals with ACPI fwnodes.

Would it not be better to add fake ref-counting to the ACPI fwnode
next_child_node() op though. I believe just getting a reference
on the return value there should work fine; and then all fwnode
implementations would be consistent ?

(note I did not check that the of and swnode code do return
a reference but I would assume so).

I wonder if we really have issues though, in practice fwnodes are
generated from an devicetree or ACPI tables (or by platform codes
adding swnodes) and then these pretty much stick around for ever.

IOW the initial refcount of 1 is never dropped at least for of-nodes
and ACPI nodes.  I know there are some exceptions like device-tree
overlays which I guess may also be dynamically removed again, but those
exceptions are not widely used.

And if we forget to drop a reference in the worst case we have a small
non-re-occuring (so not growing) memleak. Where as if we start adding
put() calls everywhere we may end up freeing things which are still
in use; or dropping refcounts below 0 triggering WARNs in various
places (IIRC).

So it seems the cure is potentially worse then the disease in this
case.

So if you want to work on this, then IMHO it would be best to first make
sure that all the fwnode implementations behave in the same way wrt
ref-counting, before adding the missing put() calls in various
places.

And once the behavior is consistent then we can also document this
properly making it easier for other people to do the right thing
when using these functions.

Regards,

Hans
