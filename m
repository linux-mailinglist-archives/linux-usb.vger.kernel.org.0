By adding the log in ohci_suspend, and then viewing the dmesg after sleep,
I can confirm that the system does not call ohci_suspend in S4 sleep mode.

The operating method of the system entering S4 sleep mode:
echo disk > /sys/power/state

The operating method of the system entering S3 sleep mode:
echo mem > /sys/power/state

In order to eliminate the impact of the kernel version difference, I tested
the S4 sleep mode and S3 sleep mode again on CentorOS + kernel 5.10,
and the log is as follows, from the comparison of the two logs below,
ohci_suspend is called in S3 sleep mode, but it is not called in S4 sleep mode.

The log of the process that the system enters the S4 sleep state and then wakes up:

This modification method is only a temporary verification method.
The normal modification method we hope is to enable ohci_suspend()
in the sleep process of S4 mode.
