To me this doesn't seem quite so much to be a weakness of the kernel's 
driver model.

It's a platform-specific property, one that is not discoverable and 
therefore needs to be represented somehow in DT or ACPI or something 
similar.  Something that says "Device A cannot operate or be discovered 
until power regulator B is enabled", for example.

The decision to enable the power regulator at system startup would be 
kernel policy, not a part of the DT description.  But there ought to be 
a standard way of recognizing which resource requirements of this sort 
should be handled at startup.  Then there could be a special module (in 
the driver model core? -- that doesn't really seem appropriate) which 
would search through the whole DT database for resources of this kind 
and enable them.

The case that Matthias is working on is even more complicated 
because he wants to add a platform-specific sysfs attribute for 
controlling the power resource.  But I think that would be relatively 
easy to set up, if only we could guarantee that the power regulator 
would be enabled initially so that the hub can be discovered.
