Thank you for the feedback.  So it is true that we lock dwc->lock while
handling EP/device events, but what these changes are trying to address
is that during dwc3_stop_active_transfers() we will eventually call
dwc3_gadget_giveback() to call the complete() functions registered by
the function driver.  Before we call the complete() callbacks, we unlock
dwc->lock, so we are no longer protected, and if there was a pending ep
queue from a function driver, that would allow it to acquire the lock
and continue preparing the TRBs.

Agreed.  That is the reason for adding the check to dwc->connected in
__dwc3_gadget_ep_queue()

if (!dep->endpoint.desc || !dwc->pullups_connected || !dwc->connected) {
 		dev_err(dwc->dev, "%s: can't queue to disabled endpoint\n",
 				dep->name);
 		return -ESHUTDOWN;

So how this change will address the issue is:

1.  IRQ handler will acquire dwc->lock
2.  dwc3_gadget_reset_handler() sets dwc->connected = false
3.  Call to dwc3_stop_active_transfers()
	---> dwc3_gadget_giveback() releases dwc->lock
4.  If there was a pending ep queue (waiting for dwc->lock) it can
continue here
5.  __dwc3_gadget_ep_queue() exits early due to dwc->connected = false
6.  dwc3_gadget_giveback() re-acquires dwc->lock and continues

Thanks
