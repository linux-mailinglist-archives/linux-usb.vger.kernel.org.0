Thanks for confirming.

I noticed one register write which was removed during 4.10 and we also
added support for setting the LCR register which wasn't there before.

Can you try the below patch which adds a register write that should
match what the old driver did at 115200 baud?

If that doesn't help, can you try just ifdeffing out the LCR update?

Ok, good.

Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: ch341: fix disabled rx timer on older devices

At least one older CH341 appears to have the RX timer enable bit
inverted so that setting it disables the RX timer and prevents the FIFO
from emptying until it is full.

Only set the RX timer enable bit for devices with version newer than
0x27.

Also try restoring a pre-4.10 register write when updating the line
settings to see if it has any effect on a lost first byte after
changing speed.

Another thing to try is to disable the LCR update, which wasn't
supported pre-4.10.
