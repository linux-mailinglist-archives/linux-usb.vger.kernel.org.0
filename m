Are you referring to the host controller driver, or to the class device 
driver running on the host?  The host controller driver is responsible 
for creating the -EPROTO error code in the first place.  The class 
device driver is responsible for taking an appropriate action in 
response.

Not true.  It does not mark the endpoint as halted, not unless it 
receives a STALL handshake from the device.  A STALL is not a protocol 
error.

Irrelevant.

That is not an easy thing to test, and syzbot is not capable of testing 
it.  You would need a USB device which could deliberately be set to 
create a protocol error; I don't know of any devices like that.
