I don't understand.  What patch is that?  Do you have a URL for it?

No, that isn't what this patch does.

If the root hub wasn't registered, hub_probe wouldn't get called.  But 
with your patch, the system tries to register the root hub, and it does 
call hub_probe, and then that function fails with a warning message.

The way to _really_ akip registering the root hub is to change the 
xhci-hcd code.  Make it skip calling usb_add_hcd.

Why do you want to get rid of the error log output?  There really _is_ 
an error, because the USB-3 hardware on your controller is defective.  
Since the hardware is buggy, we _should_ print an error message in the 
kernel log.
