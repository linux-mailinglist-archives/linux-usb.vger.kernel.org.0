To be fair, this is not a normal "common" code path at all :)

First off, you all know this is really an "unsupported" thing to do.  I
love it how the vfio people abuse this interface for their main code
path, but remember that is NEVER what it was designed for at all.  The
fact that it could possibly work at all is a miracle and everyone gets
lucky if nothing dies when they attempt to manually do the gyrations you
are doing here.

Who sets the driver_data here?

Damaged how?  Attempting to assign random PCI drivers to the vfio-pci
driver is again, really really not supported (despite what the vfio
authors think), so again, it's amazing this works, as you are finding
out.

That's crazy, why would you be doing all of that in the first place?  Is
it common to add host controller drivers to virtual machines like this?
Why not just use usbip instead?

Note, this is a very old kernel, and one that has closed source in it
making it such that none of us can debug it at all.

And are you sure this happens on 6.10?

Attempting to rely on kernel module names within kernel code just is not
going to work, sorry.

What exactly are you trying to do here?  Please at least comment it.

> +			continue;

Do you just want to fail the binding?  If so, why?  And what is
precenting a driver to be bound after you do the check?

Why doesn't this check suffice?
