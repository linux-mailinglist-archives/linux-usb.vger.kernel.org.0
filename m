Hi!

To me this bug description is very similar to what I'm struggling with 
on an amd64-platform.

When I get too much data sent via usb, it seems as the usb controlmsg is 
delayed so it times out and unmounts the block device.

I have been working on my related bug for long to get it easily 
reproducible, but failed. It is there all the time. New hardware is on 
its way so I can continue my testing.

Maybe you can test the patch I'm using to see if it works better for you?

In the meanwhile here is my description of my bug:

> I have stress tested the usb system. To the USB is now seven 
> mechanical hard disks and two ssd disks connected. Six processes are 
> at the same time writing random data to the disks. One of them is to 
> the ssd disk I couldn't write data to before without it failed. Also 
> the other usb-ssd disk is my root partition.
>
> Before I applied the patch, my root partition sometimes failed to be 
> kept mounted. Now I have not had any crashes.
>
> This is a quick fix for hard disks, but working. It continued to work 
> when I started three virtualbox guests and let them also do work. The

> It doesn't work if I also use my usb2ethernet adapter (ID 2001:4a00 
> D-Link Corp.), although my root partition and two randomize tests

Best regards,
Patrik
