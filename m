Dear Alan
Dear Greg

Thank you very much for your feedback.
I understood that there is a gap between real system and ideal specificatio=
n,
and the Linux community stands on the real system side.(of course).

I really appreciate your proposal(Kconfig option).

The patch you provided worked fine.

An excerpt from dmesg is as follows.
It detected the enumeration failure after 27.7seconds since the test starte=
d.
so,the PET test passed. [2]-[1] =3D27.7seconds
