Clearly there's a tradeoff.

Yes, I had forgotten about the possibility of synchronous suspend.  My 
mistake.

Well, you can still want to put the sysfs power-control attribute file 
into just one of the hubs' directories, and that one would be considered 
the primary.  But I agree, it's a weak notion.

The peering relation goes both ways, so it should be included in the 
hub_2_0 description too.  Given that, the driver could check hub_2_0's 
peer's DT description for the appropriate resources.

Yes.  At the cost of registering, adding a driver for, and making users 
aware of a fictitious platform device.
