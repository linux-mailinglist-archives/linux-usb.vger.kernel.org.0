How it is outsourcing by moving that same allow list over the kernel /
user boundary. It can be maintained by the same engineers and get
deployed by something like:

dracut --authorize-device-list=confidential-computing-default $kernel-version

With that distributions can deploy kernel-specific authorizations and
admins can deploy site-specific authorizations. Then the kernel
implementation is minimized to authorize just enough drivers by
default to let userspace take over the policy.

The default is secure, trust nothing but bootstrap devices.

The same image can be used on host and guest in this "do it in
userspace" proposal.
