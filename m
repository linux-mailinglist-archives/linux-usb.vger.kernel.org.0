I just found the same issue on another Stoney Ridge laptop so I’d like to  
bring up this issue again.

The original approach I took is based on the feed back from BIOS team. They  
modified the return value of _S0W method to 0, to prevent the device from  
being runtime suspended.

But since the D0 PME# doesn’t work, I think maybe it’s better to just  
remove D0 PME# from its PM CAP?
I’ll send a patch with quirk to the mailing list.
