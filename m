Sorry, one quick correction. I believe the issue actually occurs when 
you have more than one CPU and the thread is not suspended, while the 
interrupt is running. In this case it is possible that the IRQ fires the 
driver marks the URB as complete, then unlocks, the driver lock and 
calls the complete callback, but before the complete callback runs the 
other thread calls usb_ep_dequeue(). There is no way to protect against 
this condition at the gadget level and it needs to be handled in the driver.

Basically

  CPU 1                         | CPU 2
--------------------------------------------------------------
URB IRQ fires                  |                             |
spin_lock(&dwc->lock);         |                             |
                                |                             |
Driver handles completed URB   |                             |
frees resources, etc           | spin_lock(&gadget->lock)    |
                                | usb_ep_dequeue()            |
spin_unlock(&dwc->lock);       |                             |
usb_gadget_giveback_request()  | spin_lock(&dwc->lock)       |
                                |                             |
Call compelte callback         | Try to free URB resources   |
                                | again => Undefined behavior |
                                |                             |
                                | spin_lock(&dwc->lock)       |
                                | spin_unlock(&gadget->lock)  |
spin_lock(&gadget->lock)       |                             |
                                |                             |
Mark URB as compelte in gadget |                             |
spin_unlock(&gadget->lock)     |                             |
spin_unlock(&dwc->lock)        |                             |
spin_lock(&dwc->lock)          |                             |
finish IRQ                     |                             |
