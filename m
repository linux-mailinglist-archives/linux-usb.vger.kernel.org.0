It is not a large grain lock. Since event_handler() is exclusively executed, this lock
does _NOT_ block event_handler() unless attach/detach operations run concurrently.

I won't be able to verify your fixes, for it is syzbot who is seeing the problem.
But I can see that your patch description is wrong because you are ignoring what I'm commenting.

Global serialization had better come first. Your patch description depends on global serialization.
