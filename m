I had another look at usb4_port.c the flows used.  This is the call path:

tb_switch_suspend()
->tb_switch_set_wake()
->->usb4_switch_set_wake()

The flags for wakeup policy are set in tb_switch_suspend() and then 
passed as arguments down to usb4_switch_set_wake().  This enumerates 
whether wake is set for any usb4_port device and applies the flags to 
that device.

So AFAICT that means that even on ChromeOS there won't be a wake on 
connect or wake on disconnect event for suspend/resume no matter what 
the sysfs files for each port are set to.

In summary; my ask is whether we can do this:

diff --git a/drivers/thunderbolt/switch.c b/drivers/thunderbolt/switch.c
index 6a2116cbb06f9..f2f6a085a742b 100644
--- a/drivers/thunderbolt/switch.c
+++ b/drivers/thunderbolt/switch.c
@@ -3599,6 +3599,7 @@ void tb_switch_suspend(struct tb_switch *sw, bool 
runtime)
                 flags |= TB_WAKE_ON_USB4;
                 flags |= TB_WAKE_ON_USB3 | TB_WAKE_ON_PCIE | TB_WAKE_ON_DP;
         } else if (device_may_wakeup(&sw->dev)) {
+               flags |= TB_WAKE_ON_CONNECT;
                 flags |= TB_WAKE_ON_USB4 | TB_WAKE_ON_USB3 | 
TB_WAKE_ON_PCIE;
         }

That would allow the use case of "plug in a closed laptop to a dock" and 
it wakes up.
