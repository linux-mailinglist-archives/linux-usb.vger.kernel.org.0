I've got the rest two patches back to the main series and resent it
two days ago:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210324204836.29668-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
See the last two patches there.

They have been part of the main series from the very first time I
submitted it. But two months ago Bjorn asked me to detach Qcom-related
ones and resubmit to take into account his comment. Since then I
didn't hear any new update neither on these three patches nor on the
main series except you merging in the very first Qcom-related patch
(usb: dwc3: qcom: Add missing DWC3 OF node refcount decrement). Since
even being detached the patches left unattended I've decided to
combine them back to ease the re-submission process.

Note the patchset has been re-submitting for about five months
already with no comments for the last three versions.
