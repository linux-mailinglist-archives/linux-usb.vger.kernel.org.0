Yes. We might need synchronization between events, threads, and shutdown
in usbip_host side and in connection polling and threads in vhci.

I am also looking at the shutdown sequences closely as well since the
local state is referenced without usbip_device lock in these paths.

I am approaching these problems as peeling the onion an expression so
we can limit the changes and take a spot fix approach. We have the
goal to address these crashes and not introduce regressions.

I don't seem to be able to reproduce these problems consistently in my
env. with the reproducer. I couldn't reproduce them in normal case at
all. Hence, the this cautious approach that reduces the chance of
regressions and if we see regressions, they can fixed easily.

If this patch series fixes the problems you are seeing, I would like
get these fixes in and address the other two potential race conditions
in another round of patches. I also want to soak these in the next
for a few weeks.

Please let me know if these patches fix the problems you are seeing in 
your env.

thanks,
