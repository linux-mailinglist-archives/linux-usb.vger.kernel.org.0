Just a word of caution.

The problem with the usage of "sync" request_firmware in drivers is that if the
code is built into the kernel the request_firmware() could be called before the
(root) filesystem on which the firmware resides is ready.... So this will get
weird during boot because what is the sync request_firmware() going to do? From what
I know, this is why the funny _async firmware request APIs are even a thing...

(I took a quick peek into the RPI 4 code, but unlike this code it seems to fetch
from nvmem/eeprom, is this right? I had a tons-of-fun dealing with caldata and
firmware on UBIFS in UBI Volumes. So I'm prepared to test this cases. :D )

(Another possibility would be to use request_firmware_direct() here.
Though, I don't know if it would be considered API Abuse to -EPROBE_DEFER
on errors of request_firmware_direct() in order to wait for FSes to appear )

Regards,
Christian
