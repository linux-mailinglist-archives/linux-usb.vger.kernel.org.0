Hi Rajaram,

I'm sorry for the late reply.

So I agree that we should have secondary interface to the USB Type-C
ports, cables and partners, and I think the secondary interface should
be "usbpdfs", something similar to usbfs, that you can use to tap into
the protocol layer of the PD stack.

We have to interpret things especially with UCSI, since we can't even
communicate raw VDOs with UCSI, but it will still not be a huge
problem.

I'm quite certain that we should be able to solve a lot of the control
related problems that we now have (so basically lack of control) with
it, but more importantly we would then not need to figure out what is
the correct way to represent every single thing in sysfs in order to
utilise it.

I would imagine this could then at least ideally be the only interface
that also the typecd would need to deal with.

thanks,
