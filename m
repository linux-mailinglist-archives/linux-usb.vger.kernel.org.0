No commit message ? No explanation, just disable UAS on a long list

Sorry, but in that case all I can do is NACK this patch.

Please split this into a series with one patch per model, while
explaining for each mode what the problem is, including links to
bug-reports or forum discussions.

Disabling UAS is a big hammer and severely limits performance,
as it also disables all forms of NCQ which is a must have
feature to get decent performance from SSDs.

And often UAS is not the problem, disabling UAS simply papers
over the problem, e.g.:

1. Disabling it either hides issue with the XHCI bulk-streams
handling (could be a bug in the XHCI controller, or in the kernel's
XHCI code).

2. Disabling it makes the SSD use much less power since it now
cannot multi-task, so often it is hiding problems with the
power-supplied to the disk.

I see at https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel that the recommended
platform for Umbrel is a Raspberry Pi 4. Which certainly explains
the long list of UAS problems. Pi-s are famous for their USB
problems. I don't know if the Pi 4 suffers from 1. above, but I
would not be surprised if does; and the Pi certainly suffers from 2.
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1507278 is an
interesting read here. The USB-3 spec says that USB-3 ports must
be capable of 0.9 A per port, the R-Pi 4 maxes out at 1.2A
for all 4 ports combined.. And then only if its own power-supply
is capable enough; and nothing is said there about how low the
voltage drops when actually drawing 1.2A and any voltage drop
itself might also be an issue.

Also see below for some inline comments.

There is no need to specify US_FL_NO_REPORT_OPCODES if you are
disabling UAS, same for all the other entries.

These are very popular drives if these really had broken
UAS support then we would already have a ton of reports
about these.

Another very popular chipsets, some older versions of these
indeed have some issues, we have special code handling these
with chipset version specific behavior, see:

drivers/usb/storage/uas-detect.h

Which also means that UAS is actually know to work fine
on the newer models and it should not be outright disabled
on them as you are doing here!

Together with the samsung drivers + jmicron bridge chipsets you
are disabling UAS on what is probably 50% of all capable UAS
drives out there (if not 70% or more).

Did I already say: NACK ?


At the top I indicated that you should split this in per
model patches, but that was before I figured out most of
these problems are beeing seen on Raspberry Pi-s (and likely
on Raspberry Pi-s only).

What might be worth considering is disabling bulk-stream support
on the Pi-s XHCI controller by setting the  XHCI_BROKEN_STREAMS
flag in xhci->quirks for that controller.  This will disable UAS
at least when the drivers are plugged into the USB3 / superspeed
ports of the Pi.  This might still be a too big hammer though.
since with a powered-hub, or with a proper power-supply feeding
the Pi 4 (and not using the other ports) UAS might still work
and you are now taking away those options from users.

But setting the XHCI_BROKEN_STREAMS flag on the Pi 4 and only
on the Pi 4 would definitely be closer to acceptable then disabling
UAS for, well everyone, because it is causing issues on the Pi.

Hans
