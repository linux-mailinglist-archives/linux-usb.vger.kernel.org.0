Sorry about the reply delay.
I don't think this is a NEC only issue.

I was originally fixing halted endpoints at stop endpoint command completion,
did some stress testing, and was able to hit that running case on Intel
xHC controllers

See:
9ebf30007858 xhci: Fix halted endpoint at stop endpoint command completion
1174d44906d5 xhci: handle stop endpoint command completion with endpoint in running state.

I also just got a report off-list about an exactly similar case as yours, endpoint
stopped with ctx error, endpoint state was still stopped even if doorbell was
already rung.

This caused Set TR Deq command to fail with context error as endpoint was running
by the time this command was processed.

This was on a Intel host, se we need a generic solution to this.

Thanks
-Mathias
