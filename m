Right I was wrong referring to the configfs names in this context.
That must have mislead Greg.

Getting back to the topic AFAICS from what John said in here
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CALAqxLWGujgR7p8Vb5S_RimRVYxwm5XF-c4NkKgMH-43wEBaWg@mail.gmail.com/

AOSP developers somehow hardcoded a USB-controller UDC name in the
internal property called "sys.usb.controller" with a value
"ff100000.dwc3". That value is generated by the kernel based on the
corresponding DT-node name. The property is then used to
pre-initialize the system like it's done here:
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/rootdir/init.usb.configfs.rc

Since we changed the DT-node name in the recent kernel, we thus changed the
UDC controller name so AOSP init procedure now fails to bring up the Linux
USB-gadget using on the older UDC name. UDC is supposed to be ff100000.usb now
(after this patch has been merged in).

What problems I see here:
1) the AOSP developers shouldn't have hard-coded the value but read
from the /sys/class/udc/* directory and then decided which controller
to use. As it's described for instance here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/gadget_configfs.txt
2) even if they hard-coded the value, then they should have used an
older dts file for their platform, since DTS is more
platform-specific, but not the kernel one. Even if a dts-file is
supplied in the kernel it isn't supposed to have the node names
unchanged from release to release.
