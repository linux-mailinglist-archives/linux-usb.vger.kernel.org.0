I was going by my old copy of X3T9.2 Project 375D Rev 10L, Working 
Draft, "Information technology - Small Computer System Interface - 2", 
from back in 1996.  Yes, it's thoroughly out of date, but you would 
think that the nomenclature would still be accurate.  At any rate, it 
includes 24 instances of the word "residue" and no instances of 
"residual".

On the other hand, my copy of X3T10/792D Rev 12b, draft proposed, 
"Information technology - SCSI-2 Common access method transport and 
SCSI interface module", dated 1995, contains 24 instances of "residual" 
and only 2 instances of "residue".

So I guess this was never defined precisely.

True enough.
