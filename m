I don't understand the second part.  With a virtual instance, the gadget 
is physically on the host.  So if the host is suspended, how can the 
gadget do anything at all, let alone wake up the host?

What you wrote here is not what you meant; there is no /sys/bus/devices/ 
path.  Did you mean /sys/bus/usb/devices/... on the host, or did you 
mean /sys/bus/platform/... (or whatever) on the RPi?

The /sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/wakeup file on the host will 
generally reflect the setting of the USB_CONFIG_ATT_WAKEUP bit in the 
gadget's configuration descriptor bmAttributes byte.  The code that 
sets wakeup_capable is in drivers/usb/core/hub.c, in the 
usb_set_device_state() function.  You can see that it uses the 
USB_CONFIG_ATT_WAKEUP bit.

That bit gets set when the host tells the gadget to enable remote 
wakeup.  And generally the UDC driver handles this, not the gadget 
driver.

The wakeup request is initiated by the gadget driver calling 
usb_gadget_wakeup().

Yes.

Grep shows that function/u_ether.c also calls usb_gadget_wakeup().  I 
don't know about most of the gadget drivers.  The f_mass_storage driver 
has no need for remote wakeup, for example, and the same is probably 
true for a lot of the others.  You'd think that the f_hid function would 
support remote wakeup, but maybe nobody ever implemented it.
