I want to continue to shave this proposal down, but that last sentence
reads as self-contradictory.

Bear with me, and perhaps it's a lack of imagination on my part, but I
don't see how to get to a globally generic "authorized" sysfs ABI
given that USB and Thunderbolt want to do bus specific actions on
authorization toggle events. Certainly a default generic authorized
attribute can be defined for all the other buses that don't have
legacy here, but Thunderbolt will still require support for '2' as an
authorized value, and USB will still want to base probe decisions on
the authorization state of both the usb_device and the usb_interface.

A way to shave this further would be to default authorize just enough
devices to do the rest of the authorization from initramfs. That would
seem to cut out 'virtio-net' and 'virtio-storage' from default
authorized list.

The generic authorized attribute would only need to appear when
'dev_default_authorization' is set to false.
