Thanks for the explanation. I guess that in my case, given that the
serial port would emit lots of continuous data (e.g. "find /" or "dmesg"),
there's always something pending and the risk that it ends exactly on a
64-byte boundary remained low and never happened in practice.

I totally understand. I'll drop my CH34x adapters and try to figure more
suitable ones (i.e. some which work *by default* under Linux). Their
small footprint was nice but without doc they're only usable for low
speeds :-/

Thanks!
Willy
