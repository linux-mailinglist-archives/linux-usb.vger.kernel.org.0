yup, will fix

I went through a few dozen bund/unbind cycles for both drivers and things
looked good overall, but then last minute I found that determining whether
wakeup capable devices are connected doesn't always work as (I) expected.
I didn't see this earlier, it seems to be reproduce more easily after
unbinding and rebinding the platform driver.

During development I already noticed that usb_wakeup_enabled_descendants()
returns a cached value, which was a problem for an earlier version of the
driver. The values are updated by hub_suspend(), my (flawed) assumption
was that the USB driver would always suspend before the platform driver.
This generally seems to be the case on my development platform after boot,
but not necessarily after unbinding and rebinding the driver. Using the
_suspend_late hook instead of _suspend seems to be a reliable workaround.

The memory gets released when the device is unbound:

device_release_driver
  device_release_driver_internal
    __device_release_driver
      devres_release_all

Anyway, if you prefer I can change the driver to use kmalloc/kfree.

Great, thanks for taking the time to review!
