No, these crazy "ARCH_FOO" things need to go away.  For systems that
want to build "universal" kernels, why are they being forced to enable
"ARCH_*" just so they can pick specific drivers?  That is not done on
other architectures, why is ARM64 so "special" in this regard.

How do you "know" that these cores/devices are tied to specific ARCH_
platforms?  We don't, so that dependency should not be there.

Just let any arch pick any driver if it can be built, you never know
what it might be run on.  Removing ARCH_ dependencies in Kconfig files
is a good thing, please do not discourage that from happening.

thanks,
