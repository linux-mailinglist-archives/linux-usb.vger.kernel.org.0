Thanks for testing that. So UCSI is definitely working on this
platform. I guess the ACPI notifications are simply not going through.

Can you check if there are any events coming from the EC with the
following commands:

        % modprobe -r ucsi_acpi
        % modprobe -r typec_ucsi
        % grep -i acpi /proc/interrupts
        ...
        % modprobe typec_ucsi
        % modprobe ucsi_acpi
        % grep -i acpi /proc/interrupts
        ...

See if the number of interrupts increases considerable, or at all. The
ucsi drivers need to be modules of course in order for that to work.

Maybe there is something special that the OS should do with the EC on
your board... There is a weird message in your dmesg.

        "ACPI: EC: interrupt blocked"

I don't know if it's relevant at all in this case, but I've just never
seen that. I'm not an EC or ACPI expert, but I think that you only see
that if the EC event interrupt is a GPIO. I would expect there to be
also a message:

        "ACPI: EC: interrupt unblocked"

But as said, I'm really not an EC expert. We probable need to ask the
ACPI guys about this, but let's first check the interrupts.

thanks,
