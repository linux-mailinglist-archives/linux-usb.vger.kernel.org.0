Hi Felipe,

Sorry for the ping, but was just wondering if you had any feedback on
the latest txfifo resize patch series?  I think I addressed the concerns
you had about making sure we had enough FIFO size for a composition
before allowing the configuration to bind with the check_config() API.
It would ensure at least enough room for 1 max packet size for each EP
in a configuration before allowing the bind to complete.

That way we'd avoid being enumerated w/ the host, and having
non-functioning endpoints.  We've been testing these changes internally,
and they are providing a pretty significant boost to our USB throughput
numbers.

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
