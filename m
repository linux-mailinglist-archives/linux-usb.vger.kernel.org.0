We can do that, in case you want/need some info upfront you can find
the reference code here: [0]

If you - or someone else - have any advice on this I'd be happy to go with =
that!

I didn't know about it until now - thanks for the hint.

I assume it's because of alignment reasons.
Lucky me that I didn't hit any issues on ARM or x86_64.

I think the firmware is sending back the configuration that was
applied (see ch348_set_termios())

My understanding is: we neither use init_data nor modem_signal in the
driver so let's drop them for now (and add them back when they're
actually needed).

Excellent catch - thank you!

Also note to self: git grep UART_LSR_ include
We can probably replace the custom #defines with the standard ones.

And again, thank you! 0x87 translates to (which also makes sense):
  UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO (0x01) |
  UART_FCR_CLEAR_RCVR (0x02) |
  UART_FCR_CLEAR_XMIT (0x04) |
  UART_FCR_R_TRIG_10 (0x80) |
  UART_FCR_T_TRIG_00 (0x00)

For slow speeds I never receive the "Transmitter holding register
empty" interrupt/signal when using the full TX buffer.
It's not that the interrupt/signal is late - it just never arrives.
I don't know why that is (whether the firmware tries to keep things
"fair" for other ports, ...) though.

I tried to avoid having to copy & paste (which then also means having
to maintain it down the line) most of the generic write
implementation.
This whole dance with waiting for the "Transmitter holding register
empty" by the way was the reason why parts of the transmit buffer got
lost, see the report from Nicolas in v6 [1]

I never hit that issue in my tests but I get your point.

I will have to test this because I thought that:
- using 2 here makes usb-serial allocate an URB as well and by default
assign it to the first and second port
- usb-serial should not touch the second bulk in / bulk out endpoint
(as they're entirely vendor / chip specific)

I omitted replies to some of your comments because I agree with them
and repeatedly writing "ACK" didn't seem to add much value.


Best regards,
Martin
