Hi,

These are the remaining four patches of the series, now rebased on top
of the latest usb-next. No other changes.


v5 cover letter:

I have to use IS_REACHABLE() instead of IS_ENABLED() also in
include/linux/usb.h. Otherwise compilation will fail if the Type-C
class is build-in while USB is a module.

I'm sorry for re-sending these so fast, immediately after v4. Normally
I would wait, but I'll be taking a short vacation starting from right
now, and I'm still hoping to get these into v5.13.


v4 cover letter:

One more version. I used #ifdef when I should have used #if
IS_DEFINED(). Thanks Guenter for pointing that out.

I'm sending this version right away because of the holidays. I'm not
changing anything else except that one fix.


v3: cover letter:

Third version: ifdefs now in the header files as they should be.


v2 cover letter:

This is the second version of this series. The "Iterator for ports"
patch is now moved to the end of the series (5/6).

I'm now using usb_for_each_dev() in usb_for_each_port like Alan
suggested, and I'm now using usb_port_peer_mutex to lock the ports
while we're dealing with them in __each_hub().


The original cover letter:

Adding a simple function typec_link_port() that can be used to create
a symlink "connector" that points to the USB Type-C connector of a
port. It is used with USB ports initially, but hopefully later also
with other things like DisplayPorts.

Being able to see which connector is connected to a port is important
in general, but it is really important when for example the data or
power role of a device needs to swapped. The user probable wants to
know which USB device is disconnected if role swap on a USB Type-C
connector is executed.

Hope these are OK.

thanks,
