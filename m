oh, right. That's probably because the handlers must agree on IRQ flags.

wait a minute. When you mask USB_ISTS, then EP_ISTS isn't updated? Is
this a quirk on the controller or a design choice?

Yeah, sounds rather odd.

okay, please _do_ test and verify the behavior. The description above
sounds really surprising to me. Does it really mean that if you mask all
USB_ISTS and then disconnect the cable while interrupt is masked, you
won't know cable was disconnected?

sure sounds dangerous, but also sounds quite "peculiar" :-)

dunno. It may become dead code that's NEVER used :-)

Yet another thread? Can't you just run this right before giving back the
USB request? So, don't do it from IRQ handler, but from giveback path?
