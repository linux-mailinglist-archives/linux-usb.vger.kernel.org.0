I'm confused about the test case. Do I add the test case for each
SG support status of vhci_hcd and usbip_host in usbip_test.sh?
Or, do I implement the test logic in vhci_hcd code that asks if
usbip_host supports SG when attaching a remote device?
I'm sorry but I don't know what exactly you want to add.
