Yes, I do.

Right.

Not exactly.

Say the driver wants to point both ->runtime_suspend and ->suspend_late to
the same function.

If the bus type doesn't provide system-wide PM callbacks at all (which is
the case for some bus types), that only works if the device is never
runtime-suspended when ->suspend_late is about to run, because otherwise
the function in question needs to check the context in which it is running
(PM-runtime vs system-wide and runtime-suspended vs runtime-active in the
latter case) which at least is awkward and hard to get right.

In theory.

I'm not sure what you mean.

If the subsystem provides callbacks, the core will run them regardless.

If it does not provide callbacks, the core will skip ->suspend_late and
->suspend_noirq for the driver and the device will remain suspended.

If SMART_SUSPEND is not set, the core will execute all of the callbacks
that are present.

That's what I mean by "simplified".

But doing 2 is not a bug AFAICS.

It actually isn't even an inverse of FREEZE.  It is like RESUME with the
additional requirements that (a) it can never be skipped and (b) the
device need not be in a low-power state when it runs (the initial state
of it is unknown if you will).

No.

What I meant was that even if the driver pointed ->runtime_suspend and
->suspend_late (say) to the same function and it pointed ->resume_early
and ->runtime_resume to the same function, it didn't have to point
->freeze_late and ->thaw_early to the same pair of functions, respectively.

It can point ->freeze_late and ->thaw_early to a pair of different functions
that only quiesce the device and reverse that, respectively.

Yes.

If LEAVE_SUSPENDED is set in addition to SMART_SUSPEND, then yes.

The core will set the PM-runtime status to "active" in device_resume_noirq()
if (a) the subsystem callbacks are not invoked (otherwise the subsystem is
responsible for doing that) and (b) if the driver's callback not skipped
(in which case its ->resume_early callback will not be skipped too).

I don't think so.  It is the reason why driver callbacks are skipped for
runtime-suspended devices.

Yes.  A flag combined with the PM-runtime status of the device in
device_suspend_noirq().
