True. In fact I'm preparing a patch submission for this PS2 OHCI driver,
along with about a hundred other patches (unrelated to the USB subsystem).
Hopefully in a few weeks. My patches are currently on top of v5.0. What
branch/version is recommended to try this DMA update?

Here is the v5.0.11 PS2 OHCI driver, for reference:
