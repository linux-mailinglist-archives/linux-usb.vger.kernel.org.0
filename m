After a reboot from linux, the dock disappears from the PCI bus and is no longer accessible in the UEFI firmware. Hence a PXE boot is not possible. When I then boot into linux again, the dock is there again, working just fine.

I've also experimented with some powersaving related settings on the kernel command line, unfortunately without success.

First of all can you check if you are running Intel or Microsoft driver
for the Thunderbolt controller? It can be seen in Device Manager
somehow. It is possible that Windows and Linux use different "connection
manager" so that explains why there is a difference in behaviour.

In case of Linux this is software connection manager so it is Linux that
does all the tunneling. In case of Windows it may be also firmware
connection manager so it is handled in the firmware (and this might
explain why it magically works after rebooting from Windows).

In general this depends on the BIOS setting whether there is PCIe tunnel
or not. Typically there is something like "boot from Thunderbolt" or
similar option that turns it on so I suggest checking if you have
such option.
