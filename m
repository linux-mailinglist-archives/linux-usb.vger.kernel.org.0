Good question.  Right now, by default, we "trust" usb devices to an
extent.  We have been "pushing back" that boundry over time, such that
now we will validate USB descriptors to verify that they actually are
sane before allowing a driver to bind to them, and if there's any bugs
with that, we will fix them.

But we totally trust the data stream from devices, and trust that once
an urb is submitted, they work properly.

If we wish to change that threat model, great, but that will require
those that wish to change that model to DO THE ACTUAL WORK!

I don't want to see fuzzers start to fuzz the data streams of USB
drivers and expect us to fix the bugs.  That's flat out not ok, as this
is something that right now, we do not care about.  If companies do care
about this, they need to do the work as that is NOT how Linux is
currently designed and implemented.

Same goes for other device types.  I get this conversation all the time
(had it last week at a very very very large Linux company.)  It usually
goes something like:

	Them:	We want to claim that we can trust drivers to work
		properly for malicious devices
	Me:	Wonderful, send the patches to do so, fixing up all
		subsystems that rely on them!
	Them:	No, that's something that Linux should already support.
	Me:	Why do you care about this?
	Them:	Because we want to host systems in untrusted situations.
	Me:	So you want to save money by not using a single physical
		host.
	Them:	Yes.
	Me:	Then spend some of that money to do the work to make
		this happen, do not force the community to do it for you.
	Them:	...

The *_ratelimited() functions should handle this if you want to use
them.

That's tricky, we don't have good answers for that as everyone has a
different idea of how long "flaky" devices should be able to flake out
before coming back.

Totally agreed.  But again, the design of Linux right now is that we
implicitly trust the hardware we are running on.  If that design
decision wants to be changed, some people need to do a ton of work to
change it.
