Hi Wesley,

(first of all, sorry for the super long delay. This really fell through
the cracks)

The idea is this:

	struct list_head	local;

        spin_lock_irq(&lock);
        list_replace_init(&dwc->cancelled_list, &local);
        spin_unlock_irq(&lock);

	list_for_each_entry_safe(req, tmp, &local, list) {
        	/* ... */
	}

It looks to me this should work fine, no? You can also follow what
drivers/usb/core/hcd.c is doing in usb_giveback_urb_bh() and restarting
if dwc->cancelled_list is not empty after list_for_each_entry_safe().

Can you give that one a shot?
