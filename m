Unfortunately, I don't think this works in my case because I have an
ULPI PHY. It's not available until ret = ci_ulpi_init(ci); is called
from the ci_hdrc.0 platform device.

I tried the following diff yesterday. It prevents the circular device
link, therefore also the crash and even devm_* on the parent device:

diff --git a/drivers/usb/chipidea/core.c b/drivers/usb/chipidea/core.c

 			ret = -EPROBE_DEFER;

Basically my idea was to share the of_node with the ci_hdrc.0 platform
device, so that it can request the PHY itself instead of going through
the parent.

It seems to work fine but I had to add pdev->driver_override to prevent
the ci_hdrc.0 device from probing using ci_hdrc_msm (since it considers
the "compatible" value on the of_node otherwise).

This is a bit weird (I think driver_override is mainly intended to be
written through sysfs, not from kernel code directly).
That is why I did not post this as a proper patch yet...

Thanks,
Stephan
