Sure, the core is acting as a proxy for the missing subsystem
callbacks.  Still, it should be documented properly.

Also, couldn't we simplify the behavior?  Right now the core checks
that there are no subsystem-level callbacks for any of _early, _late,
and _noirq variants before skipping a callback.  Couldn't we forget
about all that checking and simply skip the device-level callbacks?  
(Yes, I realize this could lead to inconsistent behavior if the
subsystem has some callbacks defined but not others -- but subsystems
should never do that, at least, not if it would lead to trouble.)

Another issue is that the documentation exists in two separate places:
include/linux/pm.h and Documentation/driver-api/devices.rst (plus a
brief mention in Documentation/power/runtime_pm.rst).  This leads to
incompleteness and inconsistencies.  Ideally there would be a complete
explanation in one place (probably the devices.rst file) and the others
would refer to it.

But if SMART_SUSPEND is set and the device is runtime-suspended, why 
issue the ->suspend callback?  Why not just do pm_runtime_disable() 
then (to prevent the device from resuming) and skip the callback?

This suggests that sometimes we may want to issue non-matching 
callbacks.  For example, ->resume_noirq, ->resume_early, and ->resume
but not ->suspend, ->suspend_late, or ->suspend_noirq.  Is that what 
you are saying?

But highly confusing.  Maybe we can change the name to, say, 
DPM_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE.

Not only that.  The distinction between SMART_SUSPEND and
direct_complete is rather subtle, and it doesn't seem to be carefully
explained anywhere.  In fact, I'm not sure I understand it myself.  :-)
For example, the direct_complete mechanism is very careful about not
leaving a device in runtime suspend if a descendant (or other dependent
device) will remain active.  Does SMART_SUSPEND behave similarly?  If
so, it isn't documented.

Besides, it seems like a mistake to try controlling (1) and (2)  
together (i.e., with one flag).  Can we do a better job of
separating the functions of SMART_SUSPEND and LEAVE_SUSPENDED?

There probably isn't a good place for it.  We could just get rid of the 
WARN.  I've never heard of it triggering.

I haven't thought about those issues as much as you have.  Still, it 
seems obvious that the FREEZE/THAW phases should be very happy to leave 
devices in runtime suspend throughout (without even worrying about 
wakeup settings), and the RESTORE phase should always bring everything 
back out of runtime suspend.

What to do during the POWEROFF phase isn't so clear, because it depends
on how the platform handles the poweroff transition.

This may be another situation where changing a name would make things
clearer.  One doesn't immediately recognize that
dev_pm_may_skip_resume() applies only in cases where there is no
subsystem-level callback.

Okay, let's start with direct_complete.  The direct_complete mechanism
is applied to the SUSPEND and RESUME phases under the following
conditions:

	DPM_FLAG_NEVER_SKIP (or better, DPM_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE)
	is clear;  [Incidentally, since a driver can set this flag 
	whenever its ->prepare routine returns 0, why do we need
	DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE?]

	Either the device has no system-PM callbacks at all or else the
	->prepare callback returns a positive value;

	All of the device's descendants and dependents also want to use
	direct_complete;

	Neither the device nor any of its descendants/dependents is
	enabled for wakeup;

	The device is runtime suspended just before the ->suspend
	callback would normally be issued.

When the mechanism applies, none of the suspend or resume callbacks (in
any of their normal, _early, _late, or _noirq variants) are issued,
only ->complete.  Consequently the device remains in runtime suspend
throughout the system sleep.

Currently, direct_complete is never applied during any of the system
hibernation phases (FREEZE, THAW, POWEROFF, RESTORE).  This may change
in the future.

Is this description correct and complete?  Can you give a similarly
succinct outline for how SMART_SUSPEND and LEAVE_SUSPENDED should work?  
And also describe how they differ from direct_complete and how they
interact with it?  (For example, how does setting both flags differ 
from returning a positive value from ->prepare?)
