This is not the right way to fix the bug.

The code already contains a test on line 938:

		if (lba >= info->max_log_blks) {

If this test fails, the driver doesn't try to dereference 
info->lba_to_pba.

The problem is that info->max_log_blks may be set even though 
info->lba_to_pba is NULL, because the READ_CAPACITY case in 
sddr55_transport() doesn't check the return code from 
sddr55_read_map().  _That_ is what needs to be fixed.
