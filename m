Those aren't really PM states.  The specification calls them "USB 
states".

This comma should come directly after the word "launching", with no 
space in between.

What is the S3/S4 press test?  I don't recall hearing of it before.

The patch doesn't check for start of frames, that is, it doesn't check 
the INTR_SF bit in the intrstatus register.  Instead it checks whether 
controller is in the UsbOperational state.  And the patch also sets 
INTR_SF in the intrdisable register -- you do not mention this in the 
description.

The driver is already supposed to prevent this problem by writing the 
OHCI_INTR_SF flag to the intrdisable register when start-of-frame 
interrupts aren't needed.  Maybe what you should do is change this code 
lower down in ohci_irq():

	if ((ints & OHCI_INTR_SF) != 0 && !ohci->ed_rm_list
			&& ohci->rh_state == OHCI_RH_RUNNING)
		ohci_writel (ohci, OHCI_INTR_SF, &regs->intrdisable);

by getting rid of the test for OHCI_RH_RUNNING.
