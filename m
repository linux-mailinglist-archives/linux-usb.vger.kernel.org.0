Hi all,

The error is in usbtmc_interrupt(struct urb *urb) since five years. The status code EPROTO is not handled correctly.
It's not a showstopper, but we should fix it and check the status code according to usbtmc_read_bulk_cb() or
usb_skeleton.c.
@Dave: Do you have time? Otherwise I can do it.
@Greg: Is it urgent?

- Guido

The log shows an infinite stream of these before the stall, so I assume it's an infinite loop in usbtmc.
