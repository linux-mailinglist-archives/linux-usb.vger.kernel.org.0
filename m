You don't have to perform (2) if you don't want to.  You can proceed
directly to (3); the WAIT_FOR_RESUME ioctl won't return until the
device has both suspended and resumed (or the call is interrupted by a
signal -- such as a 10-second timer expiring).

Or maybe the WAIT_FOR_RESUME ioctl returns because there was a remote 
wakeup.  In this case also you would call FORBID_SUSPEND.

In fact, you should call FORBID_SUSPEND _whenever_ WAIT_FOR_RESUME
returns, unless your program has decided not to use the device any more
(in which case you don't care whether the device is suspended or
resumed).

That's all correct.
