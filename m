Who is going to distribute these host keys?  Who is going to be

Is this the same type of protocol that PCI has implemented for its use
of "trusted devices"?  If so, why not emulate what the kernel patches
for PCI do here as well to keep one common kernel/userspace api?  If
not, what are the major differences?

Is the validation going to be done by the kernel?  Userspace?  And how?
Is a chain-of-trust defined somewhere?

Again, is this what PCI has decided to do?  Surely they didn't implement
a different way of authenticating devices, did they?  (I can dream...)

This is _VERY_ close to what the old wireless USB protocol required,
right?  And I think you've tied into much the same places we did for
that protocol, but you might want to look into the past history for when
we removed that to be sure.

What is "NOK"?  And what are the two axis?  The sysfs file values?  Or
an internal variable?

If what is "set to true"?

Wait, what does qemu have to do with anything here?

And this is getting to be a complex set of interactions, testing the
combinations is going to be rough without regression tests...

That's a 2018 reference!  Are you saying that the newly designed
protocol was already discussed in 2018 and found lacking?

Can this be fixed?

Ugh, why?  Why not fix up the kernel parser to work with this broken
implementation instead?  How is any other operating system handling this
if the implementation is broken?  How was it ever tested?

Have you done this with the usb-if?

Note, Linux was explicitly kicked out of particapating in usb-if
discussions in the past by some of the core members a decade or so ago
because they did not want us to implement specifications before other
operating systems had the chance to.  So, given that this is a new spec,
has Windows added support for this yet to prove it actually can work?

What's the odds that usb-if is willing to talk to us again?  :)

Ugh, that's going to get messy fast, so putting this in the kernel might
be the simplest way if at all possible.  At least for "boot devices", or
just punt and don't care about USB devices at boot time?

USB probe sequences are slow based on the slow devices, so I doubt this
is going to even be noticable.  Have you seen any real slow-down in your
testing?

Why would the kernel be writing these values?  And if userspace isn't
supposed to be writing to these anymore, just change the permissions on
the sysfs files, OR just fail the write with the logic in the kernel
itself.

Are there any real devices out there?  Is there a test-device from
usb-if that we can use?  Surely usb-if published some example code to
prove that the specification works before ratification happened, right?

What worker thread?  The hub?

testing is going to be key here :)

Yes, usbguard interaction would be good as that's what Linux userspace
has standardized on.  Have you looked into that yet?

As mentioned before, a usb gadget patch might be simpler than dealing
with qemu, right?
