I think section 4.15.2.3 is about S3 wake up, no S0 we are discussing here.

It’s a platform in development so the name can’t be disclosed.

The only document I can find is the "Device Working State D0” from Microsoft.
It says:
"As a best practice, the driver should configure the device to generate  
interrupts only when the device is in D0, and to generate wake signals only  
when the device is in a low-power Dx state.”

Wake-up capability
Not applicable.

Unfortunately PCI spec isn’t publicly available so I can only refer to  
Microsoft document.

Sorry, what I meant is PME signaling is enabled, i.e.
"Status: D0 NoSoftRst+ PME-Enable+ DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-“

But no signal was actually regenerated when USB device gets plugged to the  
port.
So there’s no wake up event to let PCI know it should runtime resume the  
device.

As there’s no PME signal to wakeup event to signal PCI to runtime resume, I  
don’t think it’s an xHCI bug.
