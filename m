My plan is to register a separate power supply for each PDO. So for
every source PDO and every sink PDO a port has in its capabilities,
you'll have a separate power supply registered, and the same for the
partner when it's connected. With every connection there should always
be one active (online) source psy and active sink psy (if the port is
source, one of the port's source psys will be active and the partner
will have the active sink psy, or vise versa - depending on the role).

Each PDO represents a "Power Supply" so to me that approach just
makes the most sense. It will require a bit of work in kernel, however
in user space it should mean that we only have a single new attribute
file for the power supplies named "pdo" that returns a single PDO.

Let me know if you guys see any obvious problems with the idea.
Otherwise, that is how we really need to do this. That will make
things much more clear in user space. I have a feeling it will make
things easier in kernel as well in the long run.

Adding Adam and Guenter. It would be good if you guys could comment
the idea as well.

thanks,
