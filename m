Attached to multiple buses directly is kind of rare from what I've
seen. Most of the time, it's regulators, GPIOs, clocks, etc. which are
well defined in DT. If there is a 2nd bus, it's almost always I2C.

Yep, it's the same issue here with USB, MDIO which just came up a few
weeks ago, MMC/SD which hacked around it with 'mmc-pwrseq' binding
(not something I want to duplicate) and every other discoverable bus.
What do they all have in common? The kernel's driver model being
unable to cope with this situation. We really need a common solution
here and not bus or device specific hack-arounds.
