I'm also learning these details as we go.

During runtime suspend, the ACPI _PS3 method (which does exist on this
device) is called, then _PR3 resources are turned off, which (I think)
means that the state should now be D3cold.

During runtime resume, the ACPI _PR0 resources are turned on, then
ACPI _PS0 method is called (and does exist on this device), and my
reading is that this should put the device in D0.

But then when pci_update_current_state() is called, it reads pmcsr as
3 (D3hot). That's not what I would expect. I guess this means that
this platform's _PR3/_PS3 do not actually allow us to put the device
into D3cold, and/or the _PR0/_PS0 transition does not actually
transition the device to D0.

While there is some ACPI strangeness here, the D3hot vs D3cold thing
is perhaps not the most relevant point. If I hack the code to avoid
D3cold altogether, just trying to do D0->D3hot->D0, it fails in the
same way.

pci_dev_wait() doesn't have any effect no matter where you put it
because we have yet to observe this device presenting a CRS-like
condition. According to our earlier experiments, PCI_VENDOR_ID and
PCI_COMMAND never return the ~0 value that would be needed for
pci_dev_wait() to have any effect.

I tried the branch anyway and it doesn't solve the issue.

I haven't finished gathering all the logs you asked for, but I tried
to summarize my current understanding at
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205587 - hopefully that
helps.

Thanks
Daniel
