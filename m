The spec is unfortunately vague about what a halt condition is, although 
it apparently intends the various sorts of transmission errors to count.

This is generally a weakness in the drivers.  It would be nice if the 
class specifications said what to do in these situations, but most of 
them don't.

This behavior is not correct.  See the kerneldoc for 
usb_unlink_urb() in drivers/usb/core/urb.c, especially the section 
labelled "Unlinking and Endpoint Queues".

In general, the only safe thing for class drivers to do when they get 
one of these errors on a bulk or interrupt endpoint is to unlink all the 
pending URBs for the endpoint and then call usb_clear_halt() when they 
have all completed.  I know that usb-storage does this; I suspect that 
not many other drivers do.

I suppose the USB core could take care of this automatically so that 
neither the class drivers nor the HCDs would have to worry about it.  If 
everyone agrees that this wouldn't lead to other problems, it could be 
implemented without too much difficulty.

However, as you point out, in general there's no way for the host to 
know whether the device accepted the failed transaction.  This means 
that proper recovery requires knowledge of the higher-level protocol, 
which only the class driver is aware of.

Just so.

Agreed.  The minimum requirement is that the endpoint does not restart 
until all the pending URBs have completed, whether through explicit or 
automatic unlinks.

As far as I know, they don't automatically send Clear-Halt requests to 
the device or automatically unlink anything.
