Ok, I would believe in a PCI error here, hammering a xhci controller
with read/write streams to two different storage devices on the same bus
for a few hours as fast as the bus allows is a good stress test.

I tried splitting this across PCI devices, and can not seem to duplicate
the failure in the xhci controllers, now the devices fail with disk
errors after about a terrabyte of traffic, but are recoverable after
unplug/plugging them back in and running fsck.

Cheap USB storage, gotta love it...

If I come up with a reproducable failure, I'll let you know, thanks for
the help,
