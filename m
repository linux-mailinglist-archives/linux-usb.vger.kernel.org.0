That is what I thought initially which is why I got additional hubs and
a USB 2.0 PCI card to test. I am seeing errors across 3 USB controllers,
4 USB hubs and 4 slow/full speed devices. All of the hubs and slow/full
devices work with zero errors on my laptop. My keyboard/mouse devices
and 2 of my USB hubs predate motherboard update and they all worked
flawlessly before the motherboard upgrade. Some combinations of these
also works with no errors on my desktop with new motherboard that I had
listed in my original email:

2. USB 2.0 controller - WORKS
5. USB 3.0/3.1 controller -> Bus powered USB 2.0 hub - WORKS

I am not seeing a common failure here that would point to any specific
hardware being bad. Besides, that one code change (which I still can't
say is the right code change) in ehci-q.c makes USB 2.0 controller work
reliably with all my devices.
