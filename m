Hi Greg,
@Krzysztof, @Rob, please join the discussion so to finally get done
with the concerned issue.

By reverting this patch we'll get back to the broken dt-bindings
since it won't comply to the current USB DT-nodes requirements
which at this state well describe the latest DT spec:
https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases/tag/v0.3
Thus the dtbs_check will fail for these nodes.

Originally this whole patchset was connected with finally getting the
DT-node names in order to comply with the standard requirement and it
was successful mostly except a few patches which still haven't been
merged in.

Anyway @Krzysztof has already responded to the complain regarding this
issue here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201221210423.GA2504@kozik-lap/
but noone cared to respond on his reasonable questions in order to
get to a suitable solution for everyone. Instead we are
getting another email with the same request to revert the changes.
Here is the quote from the Krzysztof email so we could continue the
discussion:

So the main question is how is the DT-node really connected with ABI
and is supposed to be stable in that concern?

As I see it even if it affects the configfs node name, then we may
either need to break that connection and somehow deliver DT-node-name
independent interface to the user-space or we have no choice but to
export the node with an updated name and ask of user-space to deal
with it. In both suggested cases the DT-node name will still conform
to the USB-node name DT spec. Currently we are at the second one.
