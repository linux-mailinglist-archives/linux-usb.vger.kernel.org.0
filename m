Yes. Maybe I was not clear about that issue, so let me try to clarify.
The board _seems_ to have a provision for VBUS sensing, but it is not
working. I was not involved in this board's project and I found no
other documentation on the ACME Systems site, all I am saying here is
from reading the circuit diagram, so it is all my personal
interpretation. For hardware reasons, the aforementioned VBUS sensing
pin does not reach zero volts when the USB connector is removed, which
makes VBUS sensing ineffective. But I have tested it anyway and to
make it work, the first step is to prepare the board as specified here
https://www.acmesystems.it/arietta_power_supply in the section "Supply
power at 3.3 volt". The key here is to remove the R36 resistor, so
that the board can be fed by an external 3.3V voltage and become self
powered. Then, you add a line "atmel,vbus-gpio =3D <&pioB 16 0>;" below
the "usb2:" line in the Arietta DTD. After recompiling the kernel and
installing, it still does not work by just unplugging the USB cable.
You need to manually and carefully (!) short circuit the +5 USB line
to the ground when the cable is not connected. Only then VBUS sensing
will work and the device will accept enumeration again.

In short, the VBUS sensing code in the kernel is ok. But that is not
my point. My point is that the kernel code implies that it is possible
to do without a VBUS sensing pin. The file
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/atmel-usb.txt states that
"atmel,vbus-gpio" is an optional property. So, it seems to me like the
code should work without it, and indeed it worked. That is why I have
called this a regression.

facing this problem, reverting is not necessarily the best long term soluti=
on, especially if the code is found to be correct. But assuming the chip US=
B controller has no design flaws, and assuming it should be possible to do =
without VBUS sensing, then the present code should be missing some detail.

Indeed. We must understand properly how the code is changing the state
of the USB state machine. I do not have the knowledge of this
protocol/state machine inner workings and what are the code
assumptions in this regard.

> Marcelo, can you point where the driver hangs ? One can enable debug mess=
ages in the driver by using #define DEBUG_LEVEL DBG_ALL in atmel_usba_udc.h=
.

As far as I know, the driver does not hang. I do not have an USB
analyzer to check the protocol, but from the logs on the host side,
the gadget code seems to be rejecting enumeration the second time it
is plugged, and my assumption is that this is due to not having
detected the disconnection.

  Unfortunately, currently I do not have access to a board with AT91SAM9G25=
 or to ACME Arietta to check / debug on it.

From what I read in atmel_usba_udc.c, it should be possible to emulate
the absence of VBUS sensing by eliminating the "atmel,vbus" or
"atmel,vbus-gpio" line from the DTD file. So in principle you can test
it with your boards.
