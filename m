Of course, the driver of B may also choose to leave the device in
runtime suspend in its system resume callback.  This requires checking
the runtime PM status of the device upfront, but the driver needs to
do that anyway in order to leave the device in runtime suspend during
system suspend, so it can record the fact that the device has been
left in runtime suspend.  That record can be used later during system
resume.

The kind of tricky aspect of this is when the device triggers a system
wakeup by generating a wakeup signal.  In that case, it is probably
better to resume it during system resume, but the driver should know
that it is the case (it has access to the device's registers after
all).  It may, for example, use runtime_resume() for resuming the
device (and its parent etc) then.
