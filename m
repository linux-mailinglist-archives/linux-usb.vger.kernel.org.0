I have no idea what you are talking about here. arm64 kernels have
always been generic, but you still need drivers for each piece of
hardware, we unfortunately can't stop SoC vendors from reinventing
the wheel with each new platform and then having to add yet another
driver for each subsystems.

There are very few 32-bit arm platforms left that are mutually exclusive,
they are largely the ones that have not seen much maintenance in the
last ten years but still have users. Generally drivers for those platforms
don't have any remaining compile-time dependencies though.

Looking at watchdog drivers that can not coexist with others, I see:

- 21285_WATCHDOG (ARMv4 CATS from 1998)
- 977_WATCHDOG (ARMv4 netwinder from 1998)
- IXP4XX_WATCHDOG (Intel/ARMv5 network chip from  2002)
- IOP_WATCHDOG (Intel/ARMv5 storage chip from 2002)
- SA1100_WATCHDOG (Intel/ARMv4 mobile chip from 1998)
- EP93XX_WATCHDOG (Cirrus Logic ARMv4 embedded chip from 2003)
- SC520_WDT (AMD ELAN x86 chip from 2001)
- M54xx_WATCHDOG   (m68k coldfire from early 2000s)
- ATH79_WDT (mips)
- RC32434_WDT (mips)
- INDYDOG (mips)
- WDT_MTX1 (mips)
- SIBYTE_WDOG (mips)
- AR7_WDT (mips)
- TXX9_WDT (mips)
- OCTEON_WDT (mips)
- LANTIQ_WDT (mips)
- LOONGSON1_WDT (mips)
- MT7621_WDT (mips)
- PIC32_WDT (mips)
- PIC32_DMT (mips)
