One of the important points of my suggestion was that the resource init 
should be done _outside_ of the device's driver, precisely because the 
driver module might not even be loaded until the resources are set up 
and the device is discovered.

The conclusion is that we need to have code that is aware of some 
detailed needs of a specific device but is not part of the device's 
driver.  I'm not sure what the best way to implement this would be.
