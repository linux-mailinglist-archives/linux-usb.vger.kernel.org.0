(as you highlighted one below)  Else, I can note an assumption somewhere that soc-usb supports playback only and add the capture path when implemented.

After taking a look at this "num_supported_streams" naming a bit more, I wanted to check with you to see adds to the complexity of the terminology being used across soc-usb.

The intention of this is to define how many concurrent USB devices the USB backend can support.  So for example, if the audio DSP did support multiple USB devices at the same time, this would denote that.  This is where I wanted to make sure the terminology was right....  So in this case, to me, it makes more sense if num_supported_streams --> num_supported_devices, because it determines how many USB devices the ASoC USB backend DAI can manage/support.  This adds a bit to the reason why I think using the term "port" for explaining the SOC USB context is reasonable.

Thanks

>> Ok, I think the problem is that I'm interchanging the port and device terminology, because from the USB perspective its one device connected to a USB port, so its a one-to-one relation.  Removing that mindset, I think the proper term here would still be "port," because in the end SOC USB is always only servicing a port.  If this is the case, do you have any objections using this terminology in the Q6AFE as well as ASoC?  I will use consistent wording throughout SOC USB if so.
