Elegancy is also my concern.

My RFC originated from this patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-can/alpine.DEB.2.22.394.2206031547001.1630869@thelappy/

Here the proposed solution was to keep a pointer of all the
transfer_buffer in a local array to be able to free them when closing.
I really found that original patch to be unelegant which led me to
propose this RFC.
Comparatively, I still think my patch to be a more elegant solution,
and the original author also seems to share my thoughts.

If my patch is unelegant, then what would be the elegant/state of the
art way to free all this DMA allocated memory?
(pointing to any reference driver implementation should be enough for
me to understand).


Yours sincerely,
Vincent Mailhol
