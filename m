As I understand it (and my understanding is pretty limited, since I
only started to look seriously at the code one day ago), the reason why
mon_bin_vma_fault acquires fetch_lock is to prevent a resize from
happening while the fault is being handled.  Is there another reason?

If you disallow resizing while the buffer is mapped then 
mon_bin_vma_fault won't need to hold fetch_lock at all.  That would fix 
the deadlock, right?
