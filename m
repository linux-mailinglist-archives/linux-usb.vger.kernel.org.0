Typo, presumably intended to be Object, not oOject?

Why amend capitalisation as part of converting to REST? Normal 
Linux/Unix convention is lower case for things like filesystems.

Using a  REST admonition is probably OK but, again, why change case?

The original author used shouting caps for IMPORTANT. A change can be 
argued for consistency or if there is an established preference for 
style. But, if so, that's a style patch, not a conversion.
