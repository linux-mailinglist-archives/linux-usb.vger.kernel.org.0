Yes i think just adding the VDEV_ST_USED check in addition to the
VDEV_ST_NOT_ASSIGNED state is fine and would fix the issue.

After many years of writing virtualhere (a similar system to usb/ip
but cross-platform and different non-kernel way of doing it server
side) I've seen many drivers that issue reset at any time. Loading
firmware is usually the reason.  Also sometimes switching
configurations requires a reset also, for example some gaming wheels
do this. I don't think you should make this VDEV_ST_USED check
specific to Wifi devices, as a lot of devices don't follow too closely
to the USB protocol to begin with from my experience. They primarily
base their USB interactions assuming the windows platform and its
quirks.
