I was trying to follow the discussion, but it turned out to be a bit
complicated to catch up and answer all things. In any case, let me
just add a few overall comments, perhaps that can help to move things
forward.

First, one domain can have two parent domains. Both from DT and from
genpd point of view, just to make this clear.

Although, it certainly looks questionable to me, to hook up the USB
device to two separate power domains, one to control power and one to
control performance. Especially, if it's really the same piece of HW
that is managing both things. Additionally, if it's correct to model
the USB GDSC power domain as a child to the CX power domain from HW
point of view, we should likely do that.

From the performance states point of view, genpd supports propagating
performance states to parent domains, via a 1:1 mapping of the
performance state. Note that, we have also quite recently made genpd's
->set_performance_state() callback to be optional. A vote for a
performance state will be propagated to the parent domain, even if the
child domain would lack the ->set_performance_state() callback.  This
should be useful, where a child domain relies on its parent domain for
performance state management, which seems to be the case for the USB
GDSC/CX power domains, right?

In regards to the parsing of the "required-opps" DT binding for a
device node, I think that should work for cases like these, too. Or is
there something missing around this?

Kind regards
Uffe
