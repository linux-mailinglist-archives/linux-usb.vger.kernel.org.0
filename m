Just as I spend no time reviewing the driver side typically, I don't
think Alan or Greg spend any time on the DT side.

It's a hub. The name is not the problem.

There aren't 2 (or 3) devices here. There's a single USB device (a
hub) and the DT representation should reflect that.

We already have hubs in DT. See [1][2][3][4]. What's new here? Simply,
vdd-supply needs to be enabled for the hub to be enumerated. That's
not a unique problem for USB, but common for all "discoverable" buses
with MDIO being the most recent example I pointed you to. I'm not sure
what happened with the previous attempt for USB[5]. It didn't look
like there was a major issue. 'generic' power sequencing can't really
handle every case, but as long as bindings allow doing something
device specific I don't care so much. The driver side can evolve. The
DT bindings can't.

So what should this look like? There are 2 issues here. First, how do
we represent a USB3 device if that means multiple ports. I'm not
really sure other than it needs to be defined and documented. I think
the choices are: ignore the USB3 part (USB2 is always there and what's
used for enumeration, right?) or allow multiple ports in reg. Do hubs
really have 2 ports for each connection?

The 2nd issue is where do extra properties for a device go. That's
nothing new nor special to USB. They go with the device node. We
already went thru that with the last attempt.

So for this case, we'd have something like this:

    usb_controller {
        dr_mode = "host";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        hub@1 {
            compatible = "usbbda,5411";
            reg = <1>;
            vdd-supply = <&pp3300_hub>;
        };
    };

This is no different than needing a reset line deasserted as the prior
attempt did.
