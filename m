Dear Friend,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal
ethics. I would like to introduce myself, I am David Lambert and I work
with the staff in the accounts management section of a well-known bank
here in the United Kingdom.

One of our accounts is holding a balance of GBP48,375,000 (Forty Eight
million, Three Hundred and Seventy Five Thousand Great British Pounds)
and has been dormant for some years now. From my investigations and
confirmations, the owner of this account died on the 16th of February
1999 in an autocrash in Birmingham, here in the UK.

Since then no one has responded in anyway with regards to claiming the
funds. As far as we can tell he has no family member that is aware of the
existence of either the account or the funds. Information from the United
Kingdom Border Agency also states that he was single on entry into the UK.

I have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank officials
and we have agreed to find a reliable partner to deal with us. We thus
propose to do business with you, standing in as the next-of-kin. We will
process these funds from the deceased and release them to you, after due
processes have been followed.

This transaction is totally risk free as the funds is legitimate and
devoid of any illegal/illicit activity. Please think this over and should
you be interested, do let me hear from you ASAP.



Regards,

David Lambert
