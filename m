The functional dependency is effectively there, the driver already assumes that
the dwc3 core was probed when of_platform_populate() returns.

The device link itself doesn't create the dependency on the probe(), the check
of the link status below does.

Another option would be to add a link to the PHYs to the dwc3-qcom node in
the device tree, but I don't think that would be a better solution (and I
expect Rob would oppose this).

I'm open to other solutions, so far the device link is the cleanest that came
to my mind.

I think the root issue is the driver architecture, with two interdependent
drivers for the same IP block, instead of a single framework driver with a
common part (dwc3 core) and vendor specific hooks/data.

Good point! It doesn't really ensure that the child is probed (actually it
won't be probed and DL_FLAG_AUTOPROBE_CONSUMER doesn't make sense here), it
could happen that dwc3_qcom_probe() is deferred multiple times, but eventually
the PHYs should be ready and dwc3_probe() be invoked through
of_platform_populate().
