Hi Noralf,

Thanks a lot for going into more detail.

I understand, and it's good that these are uapi values, but I will still
disagree with using errno and DRM connector types in the USB protocol,
which is a "namespace" of its own.

That is an important point here; GUD is three things: a Linux DRM driver,
a Linux gadget driver and a USB protocol. USB protocols (good ones) are
OS-agnostic.

I understand; so it's only required for some compression types - then
it should at least be completely optional, but in any case I find
exposing/having to expose this to be awful USB protocol design and I
hope we can find a better way.

Maybe it's premature anyway? How would you feel about skipping compression
to begin with?

Why did you choose to use lz4?

Whether compression comes now or later, maybe there is a more suitable
algorithm?

Why not support R1 also in the gadget?

No strict plan, but if it helps I could make a demo device and -firmware
without much effort. You mentioned that you would like to have a
microcontroller device for testing?

I don't know. :) The root hub drivers each have one.

Okay, hopefully we can do without a PID anyway.

Thanks for clarifying this flow. It's nice not to require particular
endpoint addresses - that makes the protocol/driver much more generic.

Ack, this is clear now.

Why can't the driver probe all vendor class interfaces?

To probe fewer interfaces, a criteria other than PID can still be defined,
and doing so would enable immediate plug-and-play for non-gadget and especially
composite devices, without requiring the addition of PIDs in the host driver.

I find this possibility especially attractive for composite devices, which
may already have some VID:PID and a non-GUD primary function/interface that
is handled by another driver, such that a GUD PID effectively can't be adopted
for that device.

One example of such a criteria would be to require that the iInterface
string descriptor contains the (sub)string "Generic USB Display".

Great. Thanks!

I tried to explain that it is only well defined for the standardized
GET_DESCRIPTOR request with device recipient. The concept "descriptor"
isn't used anywhere else by other USB protocols that I know.

There are various class-specific descriptors, but they are all standardized
in USB-IF device class specs, and all of them are only ever retrieved by the
standardized GET_DESCRIPTOR request.

Because of that it's actually rather confusing to me to refer to the display
data structure as a descriptor and even use the standardized descriptor header
and naming convention when it is actually /not/ a descriptor, since it isn't
standardized and isn't retrievable with the standardized GET_DESCRIPTOR
request. Does that make sense?

Okay. The number is arbitrary, since a control request directed to a vendor
specific interface is vendor specific "by inheritance", thus also arbitrary.

Right; it's a Vendor-Specific type, Interface recipient request, thus not
the standardized USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR, and thus the data is not actually
a descriptor, hence why calling it one is confusing to me.

That would be an improvement, but I would really wish for different
terminology all together.

Sorry, I can't quite understand this.

Does read mean IN or OUT?

And what does "the host issues a status request" mean? Status is the final
stage in each (control request) transaction. I'm a bit confused here.

The way I read composite_setup() after try_fun_setup: it calls f->setup()
when available, and that can return < 0 to stall.

I expect that composite_setup() and thus f->setup() run when the
SETUP packet has arrived, thus before the data packet arrives, and if
composite_setup() stalls then the device/function should never see the
data packet.

For an OUT transaction I think the host controller might still send
the DATA packet, but the device controllers that I know don't make it
visible to the application in that case.

It looks to me like the function can stall.

In any case I think the delayed thing+continue is the wrong path.

It would be useful to investigate this in more detail. 

And I think it would be useful to have another, independent, device
implementation. I could help with that.

I think it's a very ambitious first USB project, but it is a fun idea! :)

I would like it if we can iterate to something really generic that takes
advantage of all that USB offers.

Sorry, yes, in usblp it is a bulk endpoint, it was more about the pattern
of a status endpoint.

It was true for some early microcontrollers with USB, but I haven't
seen one in many years with less than six endpoints, and usually they
have more. Some really old 8-bit ones even allowed using all 32 possible
endpoints, more than many modern IP blocks.


To me it is critical to remove this status polling, because as I wrote,
the lowest level protocol already implements very good flow control,
the application protocol just needs to use it, not invent its own.

That's heading in the right direction, but the transaction should be
NAKed rather than STALLed.

Think of NAK as EAGAIN and STALL more like EPIPE. The former is "not yet"
while the latter signals that there was an actual error.

It looks like composite_setup() might indeed not support NAK, that would
be a bug/missing feature in the gadget code, but I may also just be reading
it wrong. Either way it doesn't justify polling in the application protocol.

In addition to being redundant, such polling generates constant application-
level noise on the bus, causes unneccessary wakeups and is very annoying when
looking at packet captures e.g. from usbmon. We should avoid that.

Hmm. ARM often (always?) can't do byte-aligned access, only 32-bit access.
Do you know if and how the buffer is aligned? Maybe this can make a difference?

A more USB:y way would btw. be to report the highest supported protocol
version to the host in some data structure.

This too could be the iInterface string descriptor.

Please check this? It looks to me like it would be possible.

I have a template for USB protocols that I could use, perhaps we can make
that spec a reality. I think it would be quite valuable, to help folks
outside Linux who may also want to create a generic usb display.

So even more application-level flow control. Please let's make sure that
the protocol will simply rely on the low-level flow control here as well.

One design objective for USB is indeed strong host+weak device and the
low-level flow control applies particularly well in this case. The device
explicitly informs the host that it is not ready for data using NAK.

Mm, insignificant there as well, but in both cases it's not optimal,
and that without good reason.

Besides that, it also causes unneccessary synchronization/bus scheduling
complexity and wastes bandwidth. Control transfers and bulk transfers are
scheduled to wire time according to different rules, with control requests
taking priority over bulk in case of contention.

A control request occupies more bus time than a NAKed bulk data transaction.

Finally, besides application level flow control simply being wrong it's doubly
wrong to use the control pipe to implement flow control for a bulk pipe; those
two pipes are completely independent bus channels, and shouldn't be interlocked
without an exceptionally good reason and flow control isn't it.

Sorry - that wasn't clear to me, and that's better than internal values,
but it's still not great to declare that this USB protocol value is
locked to anything else.

It would be better to define these values independently. As long as it is
possible they can of course use the same values as the uapi, but I will
argue that they should be able to diverge, because this USB protocol idea
doesn't inherently have anything to do with Linux.

Right, a GUD device could have multiple connectors, I guess with one USB
interface per connector, but again, what does the host really need to know
about the connector beyond the supported pixel format(s)?

Thanks for mentioning SDTV - I wasn't sure about the rationale for those
TV parts in the patch. Can you elaborate on that?

If the idea is in fact to create "Linux DRM over USB" then by all means
go for it, but in that case please don't call it generic.

Ack. That does sound like it could be useful for the DRM GUD driver.

I understand - this is another place where the application requirements call
for an interrupt status endpoint. I think it should be one and the same
endpoint for all status changes.

I think that would be a big improvement.

I know the feeling and I'm glad to help, but only if the goal is indeed
to create a generic USB:y protocol, mostly if not completely free of Linux
details.

If you're actually after something more closely tied to Linux/DRM then
that's also a fun idea, but much less relevant for me.
