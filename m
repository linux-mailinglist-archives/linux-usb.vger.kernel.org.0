All this is a work on a very old SoC with an unknown number of
current/real users. I don't have the hardware to test so I would prefer
to skip any big changes. As Arnd suggests, we could just drop this one
board and the driver... or if it does not harm/bother to much we could
keep it as is, just without platform header dependency. Someone still
might be using it.

Krzysztof
