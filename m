Ah, I did not get it. That's not the solution for this case. defines in
dt-bindings are for constants which already can be in DT, e.g. IDs. Your
register values should not be stored in DT.

Again mention driver how he can map it. I mostly don't care about the
driver. :)

I think we are getting around the problem, so to emphasize again: do not
store register values in the bindings/DT but its meaning, so in your
case most likely percentages (or permille or ratio or some other value).
