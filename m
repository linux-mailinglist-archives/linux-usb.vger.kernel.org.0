Could you elaborate what do you mean by "these"? If you meant the "Fixes" tag,
then it's already there except the very first patch. Which I think could be also
tagged with one.

Logically they don't, but still the later patches won't apply cleanly without
the former ones. So I can add the "Fixes" tag to the very first patch (it would
be correct since basically it's also a fix) so all of them would be ported to
the -rc and stable kernels. Is that ok?
