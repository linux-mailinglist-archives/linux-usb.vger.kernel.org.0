I never used much mainline kernels on this machine because previous
kernels had issues and quirks making them practically unusable.
Earlier I used old chromeOS kernel (3.18 series) and from July this
summer I switched to kernels from
https://gitlab.collabora.com/eballetbo/linux/-/tree/topic/chromeos/somewhat-stable-5.7
https://gitlab.collabora.com/eballetbo/linux/-/tree/topic/chromeos/somewhat-stable-5.8
https://gitlab.collabora.com/eballetbo/linux/-/tree/topic/chromeos/somewhat-stable-5.9

They had also some issues but on somewhat-stable-5.8 and
somewhat-stable-5.9 r8152 worked, or I missed to notice this problem.

First mainline kernel which works fine is 5.10-rc1 and up (well, still
some quirks and issues) and it is usable for everyday work.
And on this kernel and up to 5.10-rc3 problem exist, right now I'm
testing 5.10-rc4 to see will that problem appear again. Sometimes it
need full 24 hours or more to manifest and I can't conclude how to
'trigger' it.
