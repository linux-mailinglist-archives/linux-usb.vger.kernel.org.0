I've applied all of these patches now, except for the usb.ids error
message that I responded to.  Note, I do not know python well, if at
all, so I just had to take your word for most of these :)

I don't like the usb.ids error message that happens here, it's not
essential that that file be found, especially given that most distros do
not ship it anymore as they have switched over to the hw database
format.  So maybe we can just drop the "error" as the tool does work
without it, or look for the hwids data instead?

thanks,
