You are talking about an "internal" hub, right?  And isn't this already
covered by the original sideband patchset?  If not, how is power
management being handled there?

I think 2 is better, as this is infrequent and should be pretty fast to
do when needed, right?  But I really don't care, just don't combine
things together that shouldn't be combined.

Then why doesn't the sideband code just properly mark the "downstream"
device a being used like any other normal device?  Why is this acting
"special"?
