Dmitry:

Why does syzbot persist in reporting useless names like "upstream" for 
the git tree being tested?  How is anyone supposed to know what that 
actually refers to?  Why doesn't it put the real name (maybe with 
"upstream" in parentheses as an additional comment)?

Furthermore, the last time I tried to submit a test patch with something 
like "#syz test: upstream 794c7931a242", it didn't work because syzbot 
itself didn't recognize the repository name!

This should already be fixed -- I can't remember when I first reported 
the problem but it must have been at least two years ago.  

If there isn't already a change request pending for this issue, can you 
add one?

Thanks,

Alan Stern
