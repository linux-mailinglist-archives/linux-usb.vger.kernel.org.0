I'm at a loss for a way to track this down any farther.  The difference 
between this patch and the previous was very small and almost entirely 
confined to actions that take place _after_ the bug condition has been 
detected.

If this is indeed caused by a race, it would be nice to know that the
two racing threads are doing.  One of them we can see in the log output
(it's calling usb_control_msg) but the other is a mystery.
