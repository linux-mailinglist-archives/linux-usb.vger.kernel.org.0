Finally took the time to give this a spin on my QCS404 dev board.

As this touches three different subsystems, and doesn't have have
compile time dependencies between the parts, I would suggest that as you
fix up the build error I reported yesterday you send v8 as three
different series - one per maintainer/subsystem. That way we avoid any
questions about whom should merge what parts and in what order.

Thanks,
Bjorn
