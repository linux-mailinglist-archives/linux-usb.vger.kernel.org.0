Yes! That makes sense to me. That function really serves no purpose.

Sure. I think it would make sense to move that
fwnode_connection_find_match() function under drivers/base/property.c
at the same time, and get rid of this devcon.c file completely.

But before that, I would like to do a change to the software node
support, if that's OK. I have to now add support for the "device
graph" to the software nodes in any case (not because of this).

I'm really not a fan of that "device graph" thing (I think it's over
engineered) but if the software nodes support it, I think we probable
need to always use it to describe these connections (because that's
what DT uses). That would leave us with only one method of describing
these connections (the device graph) compared to the three we have
now (built-in, device graph and the "references").

In any case, do we leave this series as it is now, or should I add two
patches to it - one that just removes device_connection_add/remove
functions without any other changes, and another patch that removes
that device_connection_find() function (together with generic_match
etc.)?

thanks,
