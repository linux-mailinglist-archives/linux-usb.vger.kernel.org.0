Hi Avichal,

First of all, thank you for looking into the problem and initiating this
discussion. The whole mail thread was very helpful, Thanks to Thinh and
Alan as well for all the help.

I'm looking forward to this :-)

As far as I understand, we have two ways forward here to avoid running
out of requests to send: sending data as quickly as possible (maximizing
the number of bytes sent in each packet) and filling up with 0-length
requests in-between, and spreading the data across packets. I'll call
the first one burst mode for lack of a better term.

Both mechanisms require a form of dynamic rate adaptation, monitoring
the consumption of bytes or packets by the UDC to decide how to fill the
next packets. In non-burst mode, we may still need to insert zero-length
packets if we really run out of data (for instance in case of a V4L2
buffer queue underrun), so the burst mode implementation may be simpler.

On the host side, both option should work, the uvcvideo driver shouldn't
have any problem with zero-length packets. As the driver offloads memcpy
operations to a work queue, I believe burst mode would be more efficient
on the host side as it would lower the number of times the work queue
needs to be woken up, and overall reduce the work performed in interrupt
context. If burst mode doesn't negatively impact the gadget side (from a
CPU time or a power consumption point of view), it would thus be
preferred.
