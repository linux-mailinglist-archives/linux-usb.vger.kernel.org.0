Hi Alan,

The OTG Compliance is really dead, but for non-PC host product, if we
would like to
pass USB certification, it needs to pass EH compliance test. Before
going to Lab,
the vendor will fill Compliance Checklist, it could declare HNP, SRP
and ADP are not
supported, then the PET test will bypass related test items.
