It's interesting that there's semi active discussion about this driver.

I ran into the driver being completely and utterly broken today when I 
bought a Fujifilm DPC-R1 card reader (that was unsold for ages at the 
local camera store to read out my Minolta Î±-9's exposure info) that uses 
this chipset. It will either generate an oops error or media error 
depending on when the card is inserted into the reader, but it at least 
detects it.

I've submitted a bug (#217862) about this issue. The behavior is a bit 
interesting on older kernels (as in 5.15) as it simply generates the 
"transfer buffer is on stack" error but does not detect any media in the 
slot whatsoever or attempt to.
