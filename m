I do it when Linus takes patches from my -linus branch in order to
ensure they end up in my -next branch for testing and merge issues.

I had already done the revert, I wasn't trying to keep anyone out of the
loop here, sorry if it came across that way.  I just wanted to ensure
this got resolved quickly so I could move on to other issues.

This is now 1f958f3dff42 ("Revert "arm64: dts: qcom: Harmonize DWC USB3
DT nodes name"") in Linus's tree if you wish to cherry-pick it into your
tree to resolve merge issues, sorry for the confusion.
