Right. So I'm thinking instead of sw->generation what if we expose three
new attributes:

  hw_vendor_id - Hardware Vendor ID read from ROUTER_CS_0.
  hw_product_id - Hardware Product ID read from ROUTER_CS_0.
  hw_version - Hardware USB4 version read from ROUTER_CS_4.

This should allow userspace to determine what exactly the device is and
which version it is. For example USB4 routers the hw_version is 0x20.

@Christian, would this work for bolt as well?
