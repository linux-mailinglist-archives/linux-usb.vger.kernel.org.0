Hey Serge,
   I just wanted to follow up here.  Amit has reworked the db845c AOSP
userland so that it no longer uses the fixed node name, but instead
probes for it:
  https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/device/linaro/dragonboard/+/1774872

Admittedly, it does take a short-cut.  As your algorithm above,
digging up the devices and finding the sys/bus path to read the reg
value and pipe through hexdump (which android doesn't have) seemed
overly obtuse when the address is in the node name itself (while the
only way to be sure, one normally doesn't use spectroscopy to
determine the value of a coin when you can read what's printed on it
:).  But, should the node naming be further changed at least the
infrastructure we have can be reworked fairly easily to adapt now.

In any case, as we can handle the name change now, if you want to
resubmit your patch, we would no longer object (but can't promise no
one else might be bitten).  Sorry for the delay this caused, and we
appreciate you working with us to find a solution.

thanks
-john
