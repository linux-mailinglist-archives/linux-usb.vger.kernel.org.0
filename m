Ok, thanks. So if I understand correctly the onboard hub driver should
check the wakeup state of the xHCI to determine if remote wakeup is
enabled for the controller (after all it doesn't know anything about
the platform device). Wakeup might not work properly if it is disabled
for the platform device, but it's the responsability of the board
software/config to make sure it is enabled (possibly this could be done
by making the dwc3-qcom driver understand the 'wakeup-source' property,
as the xhci-mtk driver does).
