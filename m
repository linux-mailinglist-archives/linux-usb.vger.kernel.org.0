Why would you not want to properly review and fix up all kernel drivers?
That feels like you are being lazy.

What exactly are you meaning by "harden"?  Why isn't it automated?  Who
is doing this work?  Where is it being done?

Come on, you have a small number of virtio drivers, to somehow say that
they are now divided up into trusted/untrusted feels very very odd.

Just do the real work here, everyone will benefit, including yourself.

You can provide that fuzzing right now, why isn't syzbot running on
these interfaces today?

And again, what _exactly_ do you all mean by "hardening" that has
happened?  Where is that documented and who did that work?

It would "know" just as well as you know today in the kernel.  There is
no difference here.

Just do the real work here, and "harden" all of the virtio drivers
please.  What prevents that?

Where exactly are all of these "goals" and "requirements" documented and
who is defining them and forcing them on us without actually doing any
of the work involved?
