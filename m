Hello Oliver and Maciej,

The device side, Apalis iMX6, is the one producing the small packages
and sending to my host PC. The VNC server is running on iMX6 device and,
the client, on my host PC.

I've decreased TX_TIMEOUT_NSECS from 300000 to 30000, but nothing
changed, the behaviour is the same.

Sure, for some reason I couldn't run ethtool on the iMX6 device:

/ # ethtool -S usb0
no stats available

So I ran everything on my Debian host PC. First, without any changes on
the device's kernel, this is the result (where the VNC is really
slow/frozen):

$ sudo ethtool -S enx3e5dcdead75e
NIC statistics:
     tx_reason_ntb_full: 0
     tx_reason_ndp_full: 0
     tx_reason_timeout: 222
     tx_reason_max_datagram: 0
     tx_overhead: 42387
     tx_ntbs: 222
     rx_overhead: 38375
     rx_ntbs: 529

Next, I decreased NTB_DEFAULT_IN_SIZE and NTB_OUT_SIZE from 16384 to
8192. The performance improved a bit, and this is the result:

$ sudo ethtool -S enx42ff68c1000a
NIC statistics:
     tx_reason_ntb_full: 0
     tx_reason_ndp_full: 0
     tx_reason_timeout: 321
     tx_reason_max_datagram: 0
     tx_overhead: 61617
     tx_ntbs: 321
     rx_overhead: 59341
     rx_ntbs: 759

Finally, I changed from 8192 to 4096, and the perfomance was 
better:

$ sudo ethtool -S enx3a601e306de1
NIC statistics:
     tx_reason_ntb_full: 0
     tx_reason_ndp_full: 0
     tx_reason_timeout: 56067
     tx_reason_max_datagram: 0
     tx_overhead: 83630876
     tx_ntbs: 56064
     rx_overhead: 25437595
     rx_ntbs: 847920

At 4096 I can use the VNC with my app, click on buttons and see the mouse
moving smoothly. Please note the device name changes because we're using
random MAC addresses. 'ethtool' was running on my Debian host PC. I tested
for 1min30s and then got the statics with ethtool for all 3 tests.

This one is interesting, backing to the default value of 16384, I
launched the VNC client which now is back to be slow/frozen. In
parallel, I started the ping command. The first one with 1 second
results the following (I'm pingging my host PC, using my device's
terminal):

/ # ping 192.168.11.2 -i 1

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 882.886/2968.250/5069.878/1478.425 ms, pipe 5

Ping is really slow and lost almost all packets. Next test, I decreased
to 0.1s:

/ # ping 192.168.11.2 -i 0.1
PING 192.168.11.2 (192.168.11.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.752/999.274/2751.767/799.248 ms, pipe 26

While ping is running in parallel, VNC has a better performance, I can
see my mouse running and click on some buttons. As soon as ping stops,
VNC is slow/frozen again. Also we have less packet loss.

Next test, decreased to 0.01:

/ # ping 192.168.11.2 -i 0.01
PING 192.168.11.2 (192.168.11.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.565/171.031/559.872/165.475 ms, pipe 28

And finally, the flood:

/ # ping 192.168.11.2 -f
PING 192.168.11.2 (192.168.11.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

1314 packets transmitted, 1311 received, 0.22831% packet loss, time 16299ms

12.413/7.802 ms

While the flood is happening in parallel, the VNC runs very smoothly,
and, again, as soon as it stops, it's back to slow/frozen.

I believe here the ping command is helping to fullfil the buffer, that's
why running it on parallel makes the VNC work...

Device iMX6 is running Linux kernel v6.1.65, while my host PC is running
Linux kernel v6.5.0.

I could also try to apply these patches and check how it goes. Thanks
for the information.

This is what I got from dmesg inside the iMX6 device:

/ # dmesg | grep timer

Also tested this, but it didn't change anything, VNC is still
slow/frozen.

Sorry, do you mean reducing the both NTB_DEFAULT_IN_SIZE and NTB_OUT_SIZE?

If so, I tried to reduce from 16384 to 8192, 4096 and 2048. Everytime I
reduced the value, it got better and better, VNC running smoothly.

I will keep testing to see if I get something.

Thanks and regards,
Hiago.
