HI Bryan,

Sorry for long pause on this thread, I went through USB role switch 
framework  and yes we can move to it for notification of VBUS event, but 
i am not able to find a good example in upstream, of how battery charger 
module can be notified about charger stop and charger start event if we 
don't use extcon interface for notification. I am not sure it would be 
simple regulator enable and disable call, i will discuss with PMIC guys 
on this and will come back.

In debug mode DWC3 controller will only enumerate in device mode.

I am not getting clarity about this from spec document, what i 
understand is in this case PHY signal to USB controller will get 
stop(UTMI switch will block signal from USB PHY to USB controller), so 
before to switching to control peripheral mode EUD should send detach 
event to USB controller so that it can enter low power mode, let me know 
if it is grossly wrong understanding. In any case we are not supporting 
control peripheral mode in present state of driver.

Yes in debug mode DWC3 controller should always be in device mode, and i 
believe this we can insure when we inform USB controller about attach 
event after starting in debug mode, using role-switch framework isnt it? 
may be i am not getting your statement, how device mode enumeration can 
be enforced using DT ?
