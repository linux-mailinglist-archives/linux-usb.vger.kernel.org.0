Thanks so much for posting this.

A bit of background for the lists.  I helped review previous versions of
this patchset from Howard as he worked to convert the hacks from a
previous vendor into something that would be semi-sane.  It would be
great if we can take the previously-submitted Samsung usb-audio hooks
(as published in their kernel sources for their last-year phones) and
get it into something mergable with this scheme as well, as this is the
"correct" way to do what they were wanting to do.

Although I know that is outside of the work you probably have time for,
maybe I will work on that over the next few weeks...

thanks,

greg k-h
