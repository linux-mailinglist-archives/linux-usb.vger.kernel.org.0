Yes, that's possible and this could explain the Linux behaviour but it
does not explain why it works in Windows. Also the dmesg is full of
stacktraces, not much else.

I got reply from our experts. They say that we are expected to get the
DP IN unplugs every single time we enter redrive mode. There is nothing
"special" added to the Windows side for this either so there is no real
explanation why it works in Windows and why we see this in Linux. What
they also wanted to check is that with the "production quality" Barlow
Ridge firmwares this is not expected to happen and yours is in 14.x so
is this some pre-production hardware that you are dealing with or this
can be purchased from somewhere? Where did you get the firmware?

Thanks!
