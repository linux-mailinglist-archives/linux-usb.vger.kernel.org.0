I'll try to study the AutoDischarge a bit before reviewing the last
patches. They all appeared to be only about AutoDischarge. Sorry, I
didn't have time for that yet. If Guenter is fine with those, then
feel free to add my ACK to those patches. But Guenter really should
review these in any case. Hope he has time.
