Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] Add support for the other MaxLinear/Exar UARTs
Date:   Wed, 24 Mar 2021 08:41:04 +0100

The current version of the xr_serial driver handles one one of the several
MaxLinear/Exar UARTs and UART bridges. There are currently 12 such
models. Only one is currently supported.

They were tested only on  XR21B1410 and  XR21B1424 models,
although I'm pretty much confident that the other models will also
work, as they're very close to either one of those.

Patch 1 is just a cleanup for the registers namespace. It removes
the model number from registers that are used on multiple versions
of the chipset.

Patch 2 adds a table to be used to map the register for each specific
variant of this chipset;

Patch 3 adds support for XR21B1412 and XR21B1414. The only
difference on those devices is that they support multiple UART ports.

Patch 4 adds support for  XR21B142X, which uses a mix of data and
control interfaces to setup the line discipline.

Patch 5 adds support for  XR21B1410 variant. This one is identical
to  XR21B1411, except that it uses a different register set;

Patch 6 adds support for XR2280X devices:
	https://www.maxlinear.com/product/interface/bridges/usb-ethernet-bridges/xr22800

Such devices are compound devices that are similar to the USB
UARTs from programming PoV. The only difference is the register
set.

Patch 7 updates the CDC ignore list.

After this series, all MaxLinear USB UARTs described at:
	https://www.maxlinear.com/products/interface/uarts/usb-uarts

Should be supported, except for XR21B1421. This one have just a control
interface, and uses standard HID protocol. No idea how to support it. Also,
I don't have such device to test ;-)

In order to write this patch series, I used the datasheets, plus the Linux
driver source code, available at MaxLinear, and a previous port made by
Patong Yang:
