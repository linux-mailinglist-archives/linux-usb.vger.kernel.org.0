Yeah, that would be nice.

We can't look for -EPIPE though, since GUD_REQ_GET_STATUS will ask for
the actual error. We have these to choose from currently:

  #define GUD_STATUS_OK				0x00
  #define GUD_STATUS_BUSY			0x01
  #define GUD_STATUS_REQUEST_NOT_SUPPORTED	0x02
  #define GUD_STATUS_PROTOCOL_ERROR		0x03
  #define GUD_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER		0x04
  #define GUD_STATUS_ERROR			0x05

Maybe REQUEST_NOT_SUPPORTED (-EOPNOTSUPP) or add a more fitting status
value.

If the driver sees -EPIPE this means that the device has failed to
respond properly. See gud_usb_transfer().

It does ignore all but the first... doesn't it?

You could make a patch if you care about this:

		case GUD_DRM_FORMAT_R1:
			fallthrough;
		case GUD_DRM_FORMAT_XRGB1111:
			if (!xrgb8888_emulation_format)
				xrgb8888_emulation_format = info;
+			else
+				dev_err(dev, "...");
			break;

It's only needed for the formats that are not exported to userspace.

There's no way for userspace to know that. drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_gray8()
uses ITU BT.601 rgb conversion so userspace doesn't have to know which
colors to use, but ofc it will need to know there's a monochrome display
for it to look good.

XRGB8888 is the only format that is allowed to be emulated since some
userspace only supports that one format. So we can't have a device that
supports both R1 and XRGB1111.

It could but I'd like to keep the increasing bits-per-pixel order.

I'm reusing the tv state property since that saves me from subclassing
the connector state. I want to have the value in the state because that
makes it less of a special case. Some time in the future DRM will have
proper backlight support as a DRM property, but so far no one has been
willing to invest the necessary time and effort to make it happen.
