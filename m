Those are the two prefixes which indicate an ATA command is present.  
You can find them listed as ATA_12 and ATA_16 in 
include/scsi/scsi_proto.h.

Have you tried setting the quirk flag we discussed earlier _and_ turning 
off udisks2?  Maybe also turning off the other services which generate 
these commands?  Perhaps you'll find that when the quirk flag is 
present, some of those programs _don't_ generate any ATA commands.

Sure, go ahead if you want to.
