There are no products shipping today using dwc3-qcom where Devicetree is
considered firmware. The primary audience for a longer transition is
users of the various laptops with Qualcomm-chip in them. But given the
rapid development in a variety of functional areas, these users will be
highly compelled to update their DTBs within 2 years.

The other obvious user group is to make sure us upstream developers
don't loose USB when things get out of sync.


That said, if the model defined here is to be followed in other cases
(or my other vendors) where Devicetree is treated as firmware, your
concerns are valid - and it might be worth taking the cost of managing
the live-migration code.

I'm sorry, but here it sounds like you're saying that you don't want any
migration code upstream at all? This is not possible, as this will break
USB for developers and users short term. We can of course discuss the 2
LTS though, if you want a shorter life span for this migration.


In my view, setting a flag date when the dwc3-qcom-legacy.c will be
removed will provide upstream users a transition period, at a very low
additional cost (934 lines of already tested code). If someone
downstream after that flag date wants to retain support for qcom,dwc3
they can just revert the removal of dwc3-qcom-legacy.c.

The alternative is that I try to get the migration code suggested in v3
to a state where it can be merged (right now it's 6x larger) and then
keep investing indefinitely in making sure it's not bit-rotting
(although Rob Herring did request a flag date of the migration code in
v3 as well...).

Bjorn
