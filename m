I fear that problem applies to all static code analysis tools I have seen; 
at some point, the remaining findings are simply obviously wrong to 
everybody but the tool does not get those assumptions and continues 
complaining, making the tool seem impractical.

Alan, so would you be willing to take patches where _anyone_ simply adds 
comments on what functions returns, depending on what this person might 
consider just not obvious enough?

Or are you going to simply reject this 'added a comment' patch here?

I am not arguing either way, it is just that it is unclear to me what the 
added value of the comment really is here.

And for the static analysis finding, we need to find a way to ignore this 
finding without simply ignoring all findings or new findings that just 
look very similar to the original finding, but which are valid.
