We don't want the request passed in usb_ep_queue() to be calling
giveback() IF DONE IN the usb_ep_queue() context only.

Nice, thanks for the suggestion and info!  Problem we have is that kick
transfer is being used elsewhere, for example, during the TRB complete path:

static bool dwc3_gadget_endpoint_trbs_complete(struct dwc3_ep *dep,
		const struct dwc3_event_depevt *event, int status)
{
...
	else if (dwc3_gadget_ep_should_continue(dep))
		if (__dwc3_gadget_kick_transfer(dep) == 0)
			no_started_trb = false;

So in these types of calls, we would still want ALL requests to be
cancelled w/ giveback() called, so that the completion() callbacks can
cleanup/free those requests accordingly.

If we went and only unmapped the last entry (and removed it from any
list), then no one would clean it up as it is outside of the
usb_ep_queue() context, and not within any of the DWC3 lists.

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
