If it was for preventing drivers from out-of-bound array access,
I couldn't find any reasons why we cannot remove the above lines.
So can I know if it was just for preventing xhci-mtk drivers from
out-of-bounds array access?

If xhci-mtk HC itself can continue the transaction from Y_7 to (Y+1)_n;
including the case of Y=3D=3D63, I think it's just okay to rollover to (Y+1=
).

If it's prohibited by xhci-mtk hw, or if you think this patch is not
allowed by any other reasons, can you please  tell me what
kinds of problems can happen with this patch?

Otherwise, please consider minimizing the bw constraints from
xhci-mtk-sch on your side. Note that we're still having other usb
audio headsets which cannot be configured with xhci-mtk
even with this patch.

Thanks.
