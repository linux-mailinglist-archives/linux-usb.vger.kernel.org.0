yeah, I would agree with that.

I think we can implement shutdown in core, but we need to careful with
it. Instead of just blindly calling remove, let's extract the common
parts to another internal function that both remove and shutdown
call. debugfs removal should not be part of that generic method :-)

Anything in that generic method should, probably, be idempotent.
