Sorry it has taken so long to respond to this.  The holidays intervened,

Great reporting -- thanks.

We don't need a quirk for this.  There shouldn't be anything wrong with 
_always_ clearing PSM whenever NPS is set, since the controller is 
supposed to ignore PSM under that condition.

Would you like to submit a patch for this?

> - Adding the patch that sets distrust_firmware = false to stable branches;

That's certainly reasonable.  Nobody has reported any problems caused by 
that patch, so adding it to the stable branches should be safe enough.

We could even do both.  That would help if, for example, somebody 
decided to set ohci_hcd.distrust_firmware=true explicitly.

Greg, in the meantime can we have commit c4005a8f65ed ("usb: ohci: Make 
distrust_firmware param default to false") added to all the stable 
kernels which have back-ported versions of commit b77d2a0a223b?
