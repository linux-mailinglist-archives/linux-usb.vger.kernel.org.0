It looks like the platform expects the OS to do something that our
generic XHCI driver and the PCI/ACPI layer don't do.

A quirk or similar may be needed to address that.

Yes, please.  At least try to get the information on what the exact
platform expectations with respect to the OS are.  Quite evidently,
they aren't just "do the usual thing".

With the git branch mentioned previously merged in, you can enable
dynamic debug in device_pm.c, repeat the PM-runtime test and collect
the log.  There should be some additional messages from the ACPI layer
in it.
