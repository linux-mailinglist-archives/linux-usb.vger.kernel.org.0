Tried that but need to add maximum value also and even after that 
getting some errors as below.

/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/qcom,dwc3.example.dt.yaml: 
usb@a6f8800: assigned-clock-rates: Additional items are not allowed 
([150000000] was unexpected)

In qcom,dwc3.txt file interrupts are mentioned in Optional properties 
and I also didnt find any interrupts in 8996.dtsi
