The section 6.4.1 dictates that the Capabilities Message (source or
sink) shall always contain the vSafe5V Fixes Supply object and that
it's always the first object. Therefore we should expect it to also
represent the first source and/or sink psy under the port/partner psy.

It would probable be easiest to just expose the missing details from
those extra bits in vSafe5V object under the typec port and partner
devices by providing separate sysfs files for them if needed.
