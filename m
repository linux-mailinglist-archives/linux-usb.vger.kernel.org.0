awesome, thanks a lot for this :-) It's a considerable increase in your
setup. My only fear here is that we may end up creating a situation
where we can't allocate enough FIFO for all endpoints. This is, of
course, a consequence of the fact that we enable one endpoint at a
time.

Perhaps we could envision a way where function driver requests endpoints
in bulk, i.e. combines all endpoint requirements into a single method
call for gadget framework and, consequently, for UDC.

We could add a dev_WARN_ONCE() just to catch any possible bugs elsewhere.

great, could you add this detail as a comment so it doesn't look as
cryptic? :-)

I don't remember seeing such an issue. Allocating FIFOs after we know
the entire requirements would avoid another possible situation, that of
dwc3 exausting FIFO space before it knows there are more enpdoints to
enable.

One possibility around this was suggested above, something along the
lines of:

	usb_gadget_ep_enable_bulk(struct usb_gadget *, struct
		usb_ep_alloc_desc *alloc_desc)

(please think of better names, I'm hopeless haha)
