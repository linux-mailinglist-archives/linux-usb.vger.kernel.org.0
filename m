Right. It seems to me that the problem is not killing an existing
transfer but a failure to check in case of new transfers whether
the device has been disconnected.

But that must never happen while while the device is open.
If that ever happens something is wrong with usblp->used.

I doubt it. Operation by a timer triggering a timeout must work.
