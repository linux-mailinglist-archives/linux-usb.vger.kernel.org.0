Addressed locally for v3. I changed the commit message, Kconfig prompt/help
text, and hwmon documentation to use the full name, "AMD Promontory 21
(PROM21)".

I avoided putting chipset marketing names directly into the Kconfig text and
commit subject because some AMD 6xx/8xx series chipsets can be built 
from more
than one PROM21 IP in a daisy-chained configuration, including more than one
PROM21 xHCI controller. I described that relationship in the hwmon
documentation instead.

 > Is there any documentation of the index/data registers themselves?

I am not aware of public AMD documentation for the PROM21 vendor index/data
registers or the temperature selector.

For my initial validation on an X870E system with two PROM21 xHCI 
controllers,
I passed one PROM21 xHCI controller through to a Windows VM, left USB 
traffic
idle, and let a Windows monitoring utility poll the controller temperature.
 From the Linux host I monitored that controller's PCI MMIO BAR with 
read-only
accesses. The vendor index register repeatedly held the same selector value,
and the adjacent data register exposed a stable low 8-bit value. That value
matched the reported PROM21 xHCI temperature after the conversion formula
below.

 > Any potential danger that something else (FW? SMM?) uses them too?

I did not find any other in-kernel user of this PROM21 vendor index/data
register pair or the temperature selector.

The driver only serializes its own accesses. It saves the previous index,
selects the temperature register, reads the data register, restores the
previous index, and keeps the sequence short. This avoids leaving the vendor
index/data pair in a different state for other OS code.

This cannot synchronize against firmware or SMM. I cannot rule out such 
access
without AMD documentation or confirmation, so I would appreciate AMD 
feedback
on whether this PROM21 vendor index/data register pair is safe for OS 
polling.

I also tested concurrent temperature reads while USB traffic was active 
on the
same controller, including fio against an external USB storage device and
isochronous USB audio playback/capture. I did not observe USB transfer 
errors
or audio glitches in those tests.

After identifying the register pair, I used the same validation setup to 
derive
the conversion formula by comparing the observed raw MMIO register value
against HWiNFO64's reported PROM21 xHCI temperature on Windows.

This worked because the PROM21 xHCI temperature is very stable at idle 
and the
sensor appears to have low resolution, so the value usually stays unchanged
long enough to compare both sides reliably.

I changed the local v3 branch to follow the amdgpu-style behavior by 
default.
The driver now does not wake the xHCI PCI device for a normal hwmon read. If
the device is already active, the read returns valid data. If the device is
suspended, the read returns -EPERM, matching the error code currently 
returned
by amdgpu's pm_runtime_get_if_active() based path. I used -EPERM to 
match the
current amdgpu precedent, but I can change the errno if maintainers prefer a
different one for this driver.

I kept the allow_pm_switch module parameter for now, but changed its 
default to
false. With the default setting, hwmon reads do not change the device 
runtime PM
state. Setting allow_pm_switch=Y explicitly opts into waking the xHCI PCI
device for temperature reads.

Thank you,
