Hi,

thank you, that clarifies things. I am happy with the patch itself,
but could I ask you to do two things:

1. Edit the commit description
making clear that the difference
between the base clock rate and the line speed.

2. Mark the patch specially to NOT be included in stable. We may
have
users misusing the current API.

	Regards
		Oliver
