(Sorry for the delayed response, as I've been on vacation and now
catching up the huge pile of backlogs...)

About the change to keep PCM OPEN state: I'm afraid that the
disconnection in the host side may happen at any time, and keeping the
state OPEN would confuse the things if the host is indeed
unrecoverable.  That said, from the safety POV, the complete
card-level disconnection would make sense, which has, of course, a
clear downside for the smooth transition in the application as you
described above.  But most applications should handle such a
disconnection in anyway for the normal USB-audio devices that face
more or less the same problem.


thanks,

Takashi
