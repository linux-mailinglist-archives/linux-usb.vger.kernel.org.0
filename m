Yes, correct.  The Android USB framework will trigger the pullup(1) again.

Yes, just to help verify the fix by injecting the error condition.

I see.  Currently, in the place that we do use
dwc3_ep0_end_control_data(), its followed by
dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart() which would execute start transfer.  For
the most part, we were trying to follow the flow diagram in:

	4.4 Control Transfer Programming Model

We'd technically be in the "wait for host" stage at this point, so hence
why we issued the end transfer, then followed with the stall and restart.

Thanks
