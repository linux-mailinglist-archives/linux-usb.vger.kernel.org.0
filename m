How did your host controller get into the non-UsbOperational state?  
What part of the code is responsible for changing to a different state?

It looks like the only place where this could happen is in 
ohci_rh_suspend().  So if you disable SOF interrupts there, it should 
fix your problem.

Have you tried adding those two lines of code shown above?

If you haven't tested them, please don't write back until you have.
