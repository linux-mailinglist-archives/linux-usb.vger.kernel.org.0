You're talking about what happens during a full system suspend, right?

That's right; it's supposed to work that way.  We don't want runtime 
suspend kicking in and messing things up during a system suspend.

The correct fix is to add support for system suspend to the USB port 
driver.  Currently it only supports runtime suspend, as you can see 
from the definition of usb_port_pm_ops in port.c.
