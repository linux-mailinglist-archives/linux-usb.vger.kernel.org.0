Yeah but since this driver can support multiple series of XR chips (they
might have separate register definitions and such), I thought it is a good
idea to have a header file to keep the driver sane. But can club it to the
source file for now.

Right. The reason is, the other series which can be supported by this driver
have different register widths. For instance XR2280x. I haven't used them
personally but seen this in initial driver. So I just used the max u16 type
to make the reg_{set/get} routines work with those.

But agree, I should've used le16_to_cpu() cast to avoid endian issues.

If you think this hack is not required now, I can just use u8 and worry about
compatibility later.

I'm not a fan but since I've inherited the code from initial driver (which
was GPL-2.0+), I kept it.
