earlycon_kgdboc sounds like a really cool feature. So I gave it a try
on my arm64 machine (Developerbox) and it works like a charm. So for
patch 6/9 you can add:

Tested-by: Sumit Garg <sumit.garg@linaro.org>

Plus, in order to enable earlycon_kgdboc on Developerbox I had to
implement the read() function in the early console driver for
amba-pl011 (see patch [1]). It would be great if you could pick that
patch [1] too as part of this series.
