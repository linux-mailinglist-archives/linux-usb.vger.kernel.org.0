Since commit 46ee4abb10a0 ("USB: serial: ch341: add new Product ID for
CH341A") went in fairly recently it may still be possible to revert it,
especially if the author can speak up and explain why he added it.

If I'm reading the datasheets correctly (which I should not have to,
this should all be explained in the commit message), serial TX/RX isn't
even available in the mode we're discussing here as those pins are used
for parallel mode ERR#/PEMP:

	http://www.anok.ceti.pl/download/ch341ds1.pdf

Someone might however be using the parallel interface with the current
serial driver but that doesn't seem to be the case with the programmer
in question based on some other random site which has some schematics
(possibly a different device):

You still need to make the case for why this is OK. Explain the various
modes, how they are configured (e.g. the various bootstrap pins), and
argue why claiming this PID might be acceptable. Getting the author who
added the PID to say he's ok with reverting would also help.

Just repeating "I need this" isn't good enough.

Ok, thanks for clarifying. Sounds like this should be an MFD driver
then even if the SPI and GPIO blocks aren't independent.

Would be interesting to see a proposal since we don't currently have a
good interface for handling this kind of runtime configuration.
