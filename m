I don't know, offhand.  People have posted on the mailing list numbers 
they got through testing.  uas was considerably faster than usb-storage 
(IIRC, more than a factor of two).

I suspect the two situations aren't truly comparable.

It works both ways.  Consider a non-tech-savvy person who buys one of 
these expensive adapters, expecting that it will improve performance 
considerably, and then is disappointed to find out that it doesn't 
(because of the new quirk).  They would summarize their experience in 
the same way.

Also, consider the problem that would be faced by people who are already 
using their USB-SSD bridge devices at high speed with no trouble.  They 
would suddenly experience a decrease in speed after performing a kernel 
update, and that would be considered a regression.  Regressions are not 
allowed in Linux kernel development.

I'm not aware of anyone who has ever set up a system that uses runtime 
feedback from the kernel to automatically make adjustments to critical 
configuration files like grub.cfg (other than installation managers such 
as anaconda).  However, please feel free to create such a system on your 
own and popularize it.

Part of the difficulty is that the kernel generally does not have enough 
information to tell what the cause of a particular problem is.  For 
instance, even though it might know that a USB transfer is getting 
errors and the device is not plugged into a powered hub, it's not at all 
clear that switching drivers might fix the problem.
