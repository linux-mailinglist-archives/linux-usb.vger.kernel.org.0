You have a lot of leeway.  For example, there's no reason a single SG
transfer on the client has to correspond to a single SG transfer on the
host.  In theory the client's vhci-hcd can break a large SG transfer up
into a bunch of smaller pieces and send them to the host one by one,
then reassemble the results to complete the original transfer.  That
way the memory pressure on the host would be a lot smaller than on the
client.
