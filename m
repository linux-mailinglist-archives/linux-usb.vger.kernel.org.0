Probably it isn't.

That's basically what I meant.  "rmmod xhci-pci" does an unbind, and 
"insmod xhci-pci.ko" does a rebind.

So long as you do the unbind before the reset and the rebind after the
reset, you should be okay.  Perhaps you misunderstood what I wrote; it 
sounds like you're doing the reset first and then the unbind.
