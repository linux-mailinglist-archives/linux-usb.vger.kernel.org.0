Trying to do a "control" test before I try out your bisected commit, and
Lukas' changes, but of course now I can't get it to fail (I'm on Linus'
master as of this morning (b5799106b4).

I'm using my portable USB4 dock (Plugable TBT4-HUB3C) this time (vs. my
CalDigit 4 dock) but the same ASMedia USB4-to-NVMe adapter as always; in
any case everything is PCIe so it shouldn't matter.

I don't normally use "tbauth" (I think that's all done for me via the
"boltctl" suite) but I grabbed and built the GIT and ran it anyway, for
good measure.

I'll keep you updated, I'll be at my CalDigit dock soon enough if I
can't get any failures this morning.
