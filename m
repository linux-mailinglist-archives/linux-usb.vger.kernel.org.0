Okay, now I get the picture.  The Intel PCIe card contains an 
EHCI USB host controller plus a couple of on-board USB Bluetooth 
devices and an on-board USB webcam, in addition to the PCIe wifi 
device.

Which means you're looking at the problem all wrong.  It isn't a 
USB problem at all; it's a PCI problem.  Namely, why doesn't the 
system detect the USB host controller on the PCIe board?

I have added the PCI maintainer and mailing list to the CC.  
Maybe they can help shed some light.

The original Suse Bugzilla report:

	https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1186889

shows the Realtek board at PCI address 0000:03:00.0, but there's 
no mention of a USB host controller on that board.  The only host 
controller on the system is the one at address 0000:00:14.0, 
which is xHCI and is directly on the motherboard.

Furthermore, there's no trace of any mention of an EHCI USB host 
controller in the system log.  So maybe the board has to be told 
somehow to turn that controller on before it will show up, and 
the rtw_8822ce driver isn't giving the appropriate order.

Can the bug reporter get information from Windows about the USB 
host controllers, and in particular, the one on the RTL8822 
board?
