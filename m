This maybe? https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c?h=v5.10-rc6#n1816

UAS:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/storage/uas.c?h=v5.10-rc6#n918
BOT (AFAICT):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/scsi/hosts.c?h=v5.10-rc6#n466

It would explain why the issue is only triggered with UAS drives.

The questions (from me) are:
1. From the scsi layer POV (as per what __scsi_init_queue() does),
what/which should we use as dma_dev?
2. Do we really need to set dma_boundary in the UAS host template (to
PAGE_SIZE - 1)?
3. Kind of the same question as #1: when we clamp hw_max_sectors to
dma max mapping size, should the size actually be "the smaller one
among dev and sysdev"? Or is one of the two sizes *always* the smaller
one?
