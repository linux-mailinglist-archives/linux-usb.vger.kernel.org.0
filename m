This is consistent with what I wrote.  The patch that started this email 
thread made a change to the usb-storage driver; it did not touch any

Maxime, would you like to submit a revised version of your patch?  The 
key difference is that it should abort the currently executing command 
(if there is one), regardless of whether the srb value matches.
