Please don't remove this dead code.  But if you insist on removing it
then you should make it part of the preceding comment -- otherwise
people reading the comment won't know what it's talking about.

And I really think removing both the code and the comment would be a 
bad idea.  If you do that, someday somebody will think that the code is 
missing by accident and will add it in, causing problems for many other 
people.
