So I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I have managed 
to bisect the issue down to commit

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c92a6b5d6335

With c92a6b5d6335 and with e60ac0b9e445, the drive requires multiple 
resets in the VM. With 7fb019c46eee onwards, it only requires one reset.
The bad news is that I am not able to fix it with BLIST_NO_VPD_SIZE:

$ echo "LaCie:Rugged FW USB3:0x2000" | sudo tee /proc/scsi/device_info

This is despite this being used to fix problems with some other devices:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4b1a2c2a8e0ddcb89c5f6c5003bd9b53142f69e3

I am cross-posting this to scsi list, maybe someone there would be able 
to understand what is going on.
Out of interest, why is the device called "Rugged FW USB3" by scsi but 
"Rugged USB3-FW" by usb?

Best regards,
Julian
