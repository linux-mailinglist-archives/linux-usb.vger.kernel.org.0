I've dug out the original EHCI driver, that landed in 2.5.2:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=100875066109269&w=2
https://marc.info/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=100982880716373&w=2

It already had the following qTD setup code, roughly similar to what
the current one does:

> if (!(last_qtd->urb->transfer_flags & USB_DISABLE_SPD)

The "for now" language seems to suggest that ultimately other-than-last
qTDs were supposed to be set not to stall the queue, too.
Just the code to handle this case was never written.

It seems to me though, this should be possible with relatively few
changes to the code:
qh_append_tds() will need to patch these other-than-last qTDs
hw_alt_next pointer to point to the (new) dummy qTD (instead of just
pointing the last submitted qTD hw_next to it and adding the remaining
qTDs verbatim to the qH qTD list).

Then qh_completions() will need few changes:
*
>  } else if (IS_SHORT_READ (token)
>	      && !(qtd->hw_alt_next
>           	   & EHCI_LIST_END(ehci))) {
This branch will need to be modified not to mark the queue as stopped
and request its unlinking when such type of short qTD was processed.

* The ACTIVE bit should be treated as unset on any qTD following the
one that hits the above condition until a qTD for a different URB is
encountered.
Otherwise the unprocessed remaining qTDs from that short URB will be
considered pending active qTDs and the code will wait forever for their
processing,

* The code that patches the previous qTD hw_next pointer when removing a
qTD that isn't currently at the qH will need changing to also patch
hw_alt_next pointers of the qTDs belonging to the previous URB in case
the previous URB was one of these short-read-ok ones.

That's was my quick assessment what is required to handle these
transactions effectively in the EHCI driver.

I suspect, however, there may be some corner cases involving
non-ordinary qTD unlinking which might need fixing, too (like caused
by usb_unlink_urb(), system suspend or HC removal).
But I am not sure about this since I don't know this code well.

I guess by "the driver" you mean the host controller driver, not the USB
device driver.

As far as I can see from the code in case of a short read the whole qH
for that endpoint is going to be unlinked.

Which in turn requires observing two Async Advance interrupts.
EHCI spec says that in the worst case each such interrupt will be
generated after two async list traversals.

Only then the qH is going to be re-linked with the remaining URBs (qTDs).

Although it does not seem like this all would take a lot of time when
the bus is otherwise idle the delays are actually enough to cause a drop
of 100+ Mbps in throughput for me.

If one assumes that the device has a 32 KB on-chip buffer (don't know
that for sure, but I assume that the maximum URB size the driver used
was based on that size) then a drop of 100+ Mbps would mean a delay
on the order of 2 msecs in servicing that endpoint.

By the way, it seems that others were getting even worse throughput
from a r8152 device.
People at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205923 report
getting only around 60 Mbps.

It looks like that the URB buffer size in the r8152 driver was now
reduced to 16 KB to work around this issue.

Might be, as I have said above, the cleanup procedure will also need
changes to handle these short qTDs.

Here I think it is lesser of an issue due to sheer slowness of these
devices.

So even if an URB needs some extra processing time the device should
still be able to maintain that 12 Mbps.
But I might be wrong here for USB devices with super-small on-chip
FIFOs.

Yes, I've meant the URB "transfer_buffer_length".

That's what I had on mind by saying that it seems strange to me that
the URB buffer size should be managed by a particular USB device driver
depending on the host controller in use.

Unfortunately, I doubt I will be able to work on this in coming weeks
due to time constraints, I'm sorry :(

I've went through the (short) URB linking and unlinking code
(including qh_completions()) and I haven't found anything suspicious
there, besides one thing that's actually on the URB *linking* path:
in qh_append_tds() the dummy qTD that is the last qTD in that
endpoint queue is being overwritten using an assignment operator.

While both this dummy qTD and the source qTD that overwrites it have
the HALT bit set it looks a bit uncomfortable to me to see a qTD that
the HC might just be fetching (while trying to advance the queue) being
overwritten.

Like, is C standard giving guarantees that no intermediate values are
being written to a struct when that struct is a target of an assignment
operator?

But apparently this doesn't cause trouble, so I guess in practice
this works okay.
