It looks like the "subsystem" name depends on the bus_type.name  and
class.name (for bus and class respectively).
So it is possible the two symlinks will not point to the same location
(For example, the class for typec is "typec_mux"
but the bus is simply "typec").

Given this, it sounds like option 1.) might be better, but I'll defer
to your suggestions.
