If this is for USB 2, does it use the "non-standard" hub commands to
turn on and off power?  If so, why not just use the usbreset userspace
program for that?

And how are you turning a USB 2 port into a power source?  That feels
really odd given the spec.  Is this part of the standard somewhere or
just a firmware/hardware hack that you are adding to a device?

Is there some port information in the firmware that describes this
functionality?  If so, can you expose it through sysfs to the port that
way?

thanks,
