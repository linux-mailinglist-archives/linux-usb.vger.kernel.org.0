I probably know as much as you do, but as Jernej pointed out, in some
Rockchip code it's indeed documented as some analogue PHY supply switch:
($ git grep -i siddq drivers/phy/rockchip)

In fact we had this pin/bit for ages, it was just hidden as BIT(1) in
our infamous PMU_UNK1 register. Patch 10/17 drags that into the light.

Mmmh, interesting idea. So are you thinking about registering a genpd
provider in sun4i_usb_phy_probe(), then having a power-domains property
in the ehci/ohci nodes, pointing to the PHY node? And if yes, should
the provider be a subnode of the USB PHY node, with a separate
compatible? That sounds a bit more involved, but would have the
advantage of allowing us to specify the resets and clocks from PHY2
there, and would look a bit cleaner than hacking them into the
other EHCI/OHCI nodes.

I would not touch the existing SoCs (even though it seems to apply to
them as well, just not in the exact same way), but I can give it a
try for the H616. It seems like the other SIDDQ bits (in the other
PHYs) are still needed for operation, but the PD provide could actually
take care of this as well.

Does that make sense or is this a bit over the top for just clearing an
extra bit?

Cheers,
Andre
