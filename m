I suppose that really depends on how much you changed it. If it were just
stylistic changes I'd keep the original author. Also you should list any
changes you made to the patch by inserting

    [<who>: changed foo and bar]

before your SoB.

As for the Co-authored-by, I haven't really seen it used so I don't really
know.
