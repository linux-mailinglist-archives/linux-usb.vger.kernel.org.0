HC will allways report the SoF interrupt in the all time when HC was not 
in NO-UsbOperation state.

and no WritebackDoneHead interrupt that is the issue phenomenon. and 
this situation is badly state for ohci.

The system doesn't suspend to disk completely by my test result and hc 
will always produce SoF interrupt.

I encountered SoF interrupt  issue when HC in UsbSuspend state. and I 
think when hc in

UsbResume/UsbRest/ SoF interrupt issue may be happen so I disable 
INTR_SF in ohci_irq.

So I think disable INTR_SF in suspend function which this way isn't good 
for me.

     In addition, I hope my patch was not only fix the bug i encountered 
and it can limit HC into badly state and it should be the

base limit condition and prevent more unknown problems.  In fact, HC 
doesn't deal with ed/td list and done list by the ohci spec, so

I think my patch has no risk for ohci.

       by the way, root hub state isn't completely same with HC, but the 
root hub reset and resume signaling are controlled by the hcfs bits.

and hcd can set hcfs to decide hc usb state, so I judge whether set 
SF_INT to interrupt disable register only depend on HC state.

Hi  Alan Stern,

     According to the previous statement, I think my patch has no risk 
on ohci.
