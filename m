I don't know.  You could check the git history to find out for certain.  
My guess would be every eight or ten years.

It's up to you; either approach is okay with me.  However, I do think 
that the second option is a little better; I don't see any good reason 
why the kernel should be forced to use the same numeric values for these 
flags forever.  Especially since the only user program that needs to 
know them is usbip, which is fairly closely tied to the kernel; if there 
were more programs using those values then they would constitute a good 
reason for choosing the first option.
