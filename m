Hello everyone.

For now I can identify two different USB-IDs depending on the Jumper 
position on the board:

1-2 connected: idVendor=1a86, idProduct=5512
2-3 or none  : idVendor=1a86, idProduct=5523

I'm not sure how I'd plug it to reach the Parallel Printer Interface 
mentioned before.

The advertised position of this Jumper is 1-2.
Both positions are labeled with two different chinese symbols, "2-3" is 
labeled with TTL as well.

Looking at the devices schematics I think its safe to revert my original 
commit and I'm sorry to have caused you all this trouble.

At the time I added the device I missidentified the Jumper as voltage 
level selector.

I had seen others using the board on youtube, with Jumper position 1-2;
and did not understand, why my system would not recognize it at all.


Sorry again and thanks for the effort
Jan-Niklas
