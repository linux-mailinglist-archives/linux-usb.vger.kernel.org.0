Ah, yes.  I was mis-reading the patch.

For testing purposes, set status to 0 and jump to a new goto label in 
the "else" branch.  In other words, treat it as if the suspend really 
had worked and go back to the successful pathway.  Try this out and see 
if it fixes the problem.

If it does then the reset-resume isn't needed.  If it doesn't, post your 
patch again, and mention in the patch description that testing shows the 
reset-resume really is necessary.
