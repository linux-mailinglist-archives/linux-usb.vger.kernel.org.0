Here we get to the main question again: is the device-name or an
acceptable values of the UDC configfs node are a part of the kernel
ABI? Could you provide a link to where the Linux ABI docs state that?
I failed to find it. The only part what concerns UDC is described in
Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-class-udc. But it doesn't guarantee any
device name, DT-node name or so.

There isn't at the moment. But it could be added.

Well, even if we implemented that feature, then I don't see why John
or someone responsible for AOSP support would have wanted to change
the user-space part to comply with it seeing nobody decided to follow
the 2nd case suggested by @Krzysztof (see my next comment). Especially
seeing it won't be backported to the LTS kernels as it would be a new
feature.

Hmm, what isn't backwards compatible in this solution? What I can see
is that it wasn't indeed implemented in AOSP.

Anyway looking at this discussion in the whole the logic seems to get
to a deadlock. John said there is no a solution. We suggest two of
them. One of them involves kernel changes (alias-related) and thus
user-space modifications, another one - only the user-space changes.
You say the second one isn't appropriate as it won't be backwards
compatible. The first one, which involves having both part modified,
won't be also backwards compatible and thus won't be suitable either.
Therefore the only solution you accept is reverting the patch just
because nobody really wants to provide the AOSP modification instead.

I always thought that ABI is supposed to be something what is
thoroughly documented and firmly declared to be so. It isn't something
claimed to be on a random nature but defined to be one when it's
more-or-less standardized. Thus the Linux kernel developers decide not
to change something unless it went through the series of iterations like
testing, stable, obsolete, remove. As I see it the rule-of-thumb is
supposed to be as "nothing is ABI unless it's declared as such".

So what I can infer from all of that is we aren't supposed to change
in the kernel anything what may cause user-space changes. Right? If
so the kernel will end up in a dead-end very soon.

I can agree with that only if any value acceptable by configfs
nodes implicitly gets to be ABI. But I failed to find any proof of
that. As I said above the only UDC-related ABI I found was described
in Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-class-udc. In addition to that there
is a currently testing USB-gadget configfs interface
Documentation/ABI/testing/configfs-usb-gadget
but it also claims that the user-space applications are supposed to use the
USB-controller names found in the /sys/class/udc/* directory.
