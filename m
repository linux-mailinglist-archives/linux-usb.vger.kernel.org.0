I was refering to the locking in the c67x00_do_work() tasklet callback.
Because it is currently under irq it should be disabling irq (or at least
BH) but after this patch that is no longer the case.

I'm not sure the value here, considering the highprio is not being
changed here. There are a few drivers who use highpri workqueue and
care about latencies but they are still not performance critical (to
the overall system that is, which is what I meant by that).

Thanks,
