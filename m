if (np)
         ret = dwc3_qcom_of_register_core(pdev);
     else
         ret = dwc3_qcom_acpi_register_core(pdev);

     if (ret) {
         dev_err(dev, "failed to register DWC3 Core, err=%d\n", ret);
         goto depopulate;
     }

     ret = dwc3_qcom_interconnect_init(qcom);
     if (ret)
         goto depopulate;

     qcom->mode = usb_get_dr_mode(&qcom->dwc3->dev);

Before calling dwc3_qcom_interconnect_init we are checking

     if (ret) {
         dev_err(dev, "failed to register DWC3 Core, err=%d\n", ret);
         goto depopulate;
     }

Doesn't  this condition confirm the core driver is probed?
