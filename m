Great, thanks!

IIUC your main concern is consumer platforms where PCI devices would
be hotplugged via a Thunderbolt or similar cable, and that port
would be marked as an "ExternalFacingPort" so we'd mark them as
"removable".

A device in a server hotplug slot would probably *not* be marked as
"removable".  The same device in an external chassis connected via an
iPass or similar cable *might* be "removable" depending on whether the
firmware calls the iPass port an "ExternalFacingPort".

Does the following capture some of what you're thinking?  Maybe some
wordsmithed version of it would be useful in a comment and/or commit
log?

  We're mainly concerned with consumer platforms with accessible
  Thunderbolt ports that are vulnerable to DMA attacks, and we expect
  those ports to be identified as "ExternalFacingPort".

  Devices in traditional hotplug slots are also "removable," but not
  as vulnerable because these slots are less accessible to users.

I think you should move the one you're adding
(set_pci_dev_removable()) and leave the others where they are for now.

No need to expand the scope of your patch; I was just thinking they're
all basically similar and should ideally be done at similar times.
