Indeed. There's only one clk frequency for USB so only one performance
state/required-opps is used. In general that isn't the case and so we'll
eventually need to map some GDSC on/off state to the clk frequency of
whatever clk domain is associated with CX for a device.

When the binding was introduced I recall we punted on the parent child
conversion stuff. One problem at a time. There's also the possibility
for a power domain to be parented by multiple power domains so
translation tables need to account for that.

Even for this case, we should be able to have the GDSC map the on state
to some performance state in the parent domain. Maybe we need to add
some code to the gdsc.c file to set a performance state on the parent
domain when it is turned on. I'm not sure where the value for that perf
state comes from. I guess we can hardcode it in the driver for now and
if it needs to be multiple values based on the clk frequency we can push
it out to an OPP table or something like that.

Yes, a GDSC is really a gate on a parent power domain like CX or MMCX,
etc. Is the display subsystem an example of different clk frequencies
wanting to change the perf state of CX? If so it's a good place to work
out the translation scheme for devices that aren't listing the CX power
domain in DT.
