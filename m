I see your bug report (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203673)
but it doesn't say anything about what this looks like to a user.
Presumably somebody complained about something not working.  The bug
report should include that information about what isn't working.
Ideally, a user experiencing a problem should be able to google for
the symptoms and find the bug report.

If I understand correctly, Linux normally clears PME-Enable while
devices are in D0, but sets PME-Enable if a device is "runtime
suspended to D0".

I'm not sure I'd describe that as "suspended", since the power
management state is exactly D0 and the only difference is that a PME
interrupt is enabled.  It sounds to me like the xHCI controller is
basically using PME as a hotplug interrupt to say "something happened
on my secondary (USB) interface".  But that's more a question for
Rafael.

And I guess this patch basically means we wouldn't call the driver's
suspend callback if we're merely going to stay at D0, so the driver
would have no idea anything happened.  That might match
Documentation/power/pci.txt better, because it suggests that the
suspend callback is related to putting a device in a low-power state,
and D0 is not a low-power state.

Maybe we should also update Documentation/power/pci.txt to say "PCI
devices ... can be programmed to generate PMEs while in any state
(D0-D3)" instead of "a low-power state (D1-D3)".

Anyway, this is all Rafael's area, so I'll defer to him.
