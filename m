Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] USB: EHCI: ehci-mv: make HSIC work

please have a look at the three patches chained to this message. They
are independent of each other and can be applied iny any order.

My main objective was to make HSIC work on MMP3. The PHY patch is
loosely related to that (there's no MMP3 HSIC PHY driver, but the NOP
is sufficient). The last one is a cosmetic thing.

Compared to first submission, the patches are now submitted as series
and the wording of the third one's commit message has been changed.

Thank you,
Lubo
