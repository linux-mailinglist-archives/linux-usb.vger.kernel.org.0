Mmmm, the USB gadget has changed from since we've implemented it, such
as going from Android gadget to Configfs.  Don't forget, we do have
other business segments that use this feature in other configurations as
well :).

Don't get me wrong, I think once those features become available
upstream, we can improve the logic.  From what I remember when looking
at Andy Shevchenko's Github, the Intel tracer downstream changes were
just to remove physical EP1 and 2 from the DWC3 endpoint list.  If that
was the change which ended up upstream for the Intel tracer then we
could improve the logic to avoid re-sizing those particular EPs.
However, I'm not sure how the changes would look like in the end, so I
would like to wait later down the line to include that :).

Ah, I see.  DWC3.1 and DWC3 both have that USB performance section.  I
can explain some of the points I made with a bit more detail.  I thought
you still had access to it.

So when I mention the RX/TX thresholds, this is different than the FIFO
resize.  The RX/TX threshold is used by the controller to determine when
to send or receive data based on the number of available FIFOs.  So for
the TX case, if we set the TX threshold, the controller will not start
transmitting data over the link after X amount of packets are copied to
the TXFIFO.  So for example, a TXFIFO size of 6 w/ a TX threshold of 3,
means that the controller will wait for 3 FIFO slots to be filled before
it sends the data.  So as you can see, with our configuration of TX FIFO
size of 2 and TX threshold of 1, this would really be not beneficial to
us, because we can only change the TX threshold to 2 at max, and at
least in my observations, once we have to go out to system memory to
fetch the next data packet, that latency takes enough time for the
controller to end the current burst.

Haha...true, we question their designs only when there's something
clearly wrong, but the AXI/AHB settings look good.  :)

I used to be a customer facing engineer, so honestly I did see some
really interesting and crazy designs.  Again, we do have non-Android
products that use the same code, and it has been working in there for a
few years as well.  The TXFIFO sizing really has helped with multimedia
use cases, which use isoc endpoints, since esp. in those lower end CPU
chips where latencies across the system are much larger, and a missed
ISOC interval leads to a pop in your ear.
