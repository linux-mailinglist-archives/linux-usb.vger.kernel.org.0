"[RFC PATCH] USB:XHCI:Adjust the log level of hub"
The current method is an improved method of the above patch.
This patch just make it skip registering USB-3 root hub if that hub has no ports,
after skipping registering, no port will not report error log,the goal of this
patch is reached without error log output.
Thanks.
Longfang.
