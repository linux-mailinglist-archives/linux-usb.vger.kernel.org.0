What is the reason for doing this?

At first glance, it appears you have added a great deal of complexity
to the driver.  The patch replaces a large amount of easily understood
(albeit rather repetitious) code with an approximately equal amount
of rather complicated code.  This does not seem like an improvement.

Furthermore, the code you removed is flexible; it easily allows for
small variations as neede by some command handlers.  But the code you
added is all table-driven, which does not easily permit arbitrary
variations.

I don't see the point of adding 75 lines to the kernel source if they
don't accomplish anything new.
