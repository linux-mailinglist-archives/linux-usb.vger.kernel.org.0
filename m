Are any of them in the kernel today?

PCI drivers should not be messing with this, we have had well over a
decade to fix that up.

Pointers to them?

PCI devices are not enumerated in a standard way???

That's horrible, don't try to protect the kernel from itself.  Just fix
the drivers.

If you point me at them, I will be glad to have a look and throw some
interns on them.

But really, you all could have fixed them up by now if Intel really
cared about it :(

Please do.
