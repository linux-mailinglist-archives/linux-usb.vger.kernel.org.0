We can make a comparison between clk rate notifiers. Anyone can
subscribe to a clk rate notification and react to the notification. A
generic dual role notification system should allow for something
similar. I really don't get why folks want to treat a glue and core
driver differently in this case.

Why do we want to pass function pointers around instead of letting
whatever role notification mechanism to be able to notify more than one
user?

Also keep in mind that we have dwc3 implementations which are dual role
capable but don't ship the synopsys DRD block. Rather, there's a
peripheral-only dwc3 instance and a separate xhci with custom logic
handling role swap.

If we were to provide a dwc3-specific role swap function-pointer based
interface, we would just create yet another special case for this. A
better approach would be to start consolidating all of these different
role-swap mechanisms in a generic layer that "knows-it-all". If dwc3 is
generating the role notification or a separate type-c controller or even
some EC IRQ, that shouldn't matter for the listeners.
