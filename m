The more if-then clauses you have, the harder it gets for a human to
make sense of the binding documents.

By cleaning up the current clauses in four groups which reflect actual
classes of hardware and not just arbitrary reordering and omission, it
will make it much easier next time a new SoC is added. Most likely it
belongs in the latest category, and a reviewer can more easily spot new
mistakes if someone tries to add yet another permutation.

So it's not so much about the code as the messy binding schema this
results in and that that makes it harder to spot mistakes next time an
SoC is upstreamed.
