I'm wary of runtime PM enabling the main clock controller. Does it work?

I can understand that we need to get the CX power domain pointer into
the gdsc code somehow, and thus setting the power domain to CX in DT is
a way to do that. Why do we need to runtime pm enable the clk controller
though? Just to make genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_name() hand us a genpd? I
see in commit 3652265514f5 that we also use it to have gdsc_enable()
enable the parent domain by using runtime PM to get the clk controller
and enable the parent domain. That is convoluted.

I'd prefer if we could list that the parent domain is in the registering
device's power-domain index number, ala clk_parent_data, so that we
don't have to make the power domain provider into a consumer itself.
This would clean up the gdsc code so that it doesn't have to go from the
provider's genpd enable through the provider device to the parent power
domain enable. Obviously it works but it's hard to follow.

Rajendra can correct me, but I believe every device that has a GDSC
gating power to it is actually inside CX and MX. The CX is for digital
logic (think registers and interrupts, fetching data from the bus, etc.)
and the MX is for memories (think flops that retain state of registers
and internal state of the device). In more modern SoCs they've split
multimedia (MMCX) and GPU (gpu_gx) out of CX and supply it with a
different voltage supply and pin on the SoC package. Historically, MX
voltage has been maintained by the power manager, RPM or RPMh, so that
when CX is changed, MX >= CX constraints are maintained. I think that
also changed over time though and MX had to be controlled in addition to
CX on some firmwares. I recall we had some constraint code that bumped
up MX whenever CX got higher than it. Having to control both led to more
round trip time when changing clk rates though so it got combined on the
backend so that only one message had to be sent to the RPM.

We probably ought to list both CX and MX as power-domains on the clk
nodes that provide GDSCs to match the hardware. Then we need to know
which power domain each GDSC wants to set a minimum level on. That would
be the most correct way to do it.
