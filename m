Allow me to reorder your two questions:

> And why using a notifier need to concern core's deferral probe?

The problem at hand calls for the core for somehow invoking
dwc3_qcom_vbus_overrride_enable() with a pointer to dwc3_qcom passed.

This means that dwc3-qcom somehow needs to inform the dwc3-core about
this (and stash the pointer). And this can't be done until dwc3-core
actually exist, which it won't until dwc3_probe() has completed
successfully (or in particular allocated struct dwc).

> Why do you think we need to retry the parent's probe again?

There's four options here:

0) Hope that of_platform_populate() always succeeds in invoking
dwc3_probe() on the first attempt, so that it is available when
of_find_device_by_node() is invoked in dwc3_qcom_probe() (and a few of
the other platform's drivers).

1) Ensure that the operations performed by dwc3_probe() happens
synchronously and return a failure to dwc3-qcom, which depending on how
dwc3_probe() failed can propagate that failure - i.e. either probe defer
or clean up its resources if the failure from dwc3-core is permanent.

2) Register the dwc3-core and then return from dwc3_qcom_probe() in some
half-initialized state and through some yet to be invented notification
mechanism continue the tail of dwc3_qcom_probe() once dwc3_probe() has
finished. But I know of no such notification mechanism in place today
and we can just register a callback, because of 1).
Furthermore we'd leave dwc3-qcom half-initialized until the dwc3-core is
done probing - which might never happen.

3) Make drvdata of all the platform drivers be some known struct that
dwc3-core can retrieve and dereference - containing the optional
callback to the role_switch callback.


We've tried the option 0) for a few years now. Option 2) is a variant of
what we have today, where we patch one problem up and hope that nothing
unexpected happens until things has fully probed. We're doing 3) in
various other places, but in my view it's abusing a void * and has to be
kept synchronized between all the possible parent drivers.

Left is 1), which will take some refactoring, but will leave the
interaction between the two drivers in a state that's very easy to
reason about.

The shortcoming of having dwc3_qcom_probe() invoke dwc3_probe()
"manually" and then returning -EPROBE_DEFER if the dwc3-core's resources
aren't yet available is that we're wasting some time tearing down the
dwc3-qcom state and then re-initialize it next time this is attempted.

But as this is the idiomatic way to deal with the problem of "resources
not yet ready" there are mitigation being put in place to reduce the
number of such attempts being made.
