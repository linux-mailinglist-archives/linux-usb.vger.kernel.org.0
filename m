It's made for a specific piece of hardware that will only be produced in miniscule numbers. In turn that means removing existing modules to replace them with my own is a possibility.

We take kernel drivers into the tree for only one piece of hardware in
the world, and one user.  So don't think that we would not take such a
thing, if it were actually needed (see below...)

The only way I can think of to circumvent this is by turning the program into a kernel module as that will allow it to start before the OS and to shutdown after the OS, which would be acceptable.

Just fix your system to do this better.  You can start your program
_REALLY_ early at boot, and just never stop running it until you power
down.  That control is up to you, you do not have to be a kernel module
to do that at all.

In fact, you could run your code _before_ kernel modules are loaded, by
putting it into the initramfs, if you really need it.

This isn't a kernel issue, but a userspace configuration issue, that you
have control over fixing.

> - Providing sensor data: The microcontroller has voltage sensors and temperature sensors that I would like to make available to userspace through the normal hwmon interfaces. According to my research that is only possible using a kernel module. Funnily enough that part is already implemented and works provided I feed it mocked data.

Why not use a userspace USB driver to talk to the device and do it that
way?  Why does it have to be a kernel driver?

Userspace USB code works just fine for this too.

> As a secondary functionality it would be amazing if I somehow could still forward that device as a tty (as it currently is) so I can flash firmware using avrdude. I was thinking that as long as nothing is using that tty in userspace, the kernel module listens to the device and sends responses but stops doing that as soon as the tty is in use and also continues listening again as soon as it's no longer in use. While this would be amazing to have it's not required for our use case.

I don't understand what you mean by this.

In short, I think you should be able to do everything you want/need from
userspace today, no kernel programming needed.

good luck!
