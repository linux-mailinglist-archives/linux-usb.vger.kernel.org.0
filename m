Yes, for unrelated (i.e., not in a parent-child relation) devices, the 
PM subsystem doesn't guarantee ordering of suspend and resume callbacks.  
You can enforce the ordering by using device_pm_wait_for_dev().  But the 
suspend_late approach seems like a better solution in this case.

No, that's fine.  I just wasn't sure about this and wanted to check.
