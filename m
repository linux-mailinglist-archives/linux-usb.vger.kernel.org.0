When doing upstream development I try to look beyond my specific use case
and aim for solutions that are generally useful.

I don't know how common a configuration like the one on your office computer
is. If it isn't a fringe case it seems like we should support it if feasible.

Yes, this muddling of the xhci-plat code with the handling of hubs was
one of my concerns, but who am I to argue if you as USB maintainer see
that preferable over a dedicated driver. I suppose you are taking into
account that there will be a need for code for different hub models that
has to live somewhere (could be a dedicated file or directory).

And even if it is not my specific use case it would be nice to support
hubs that are part of a hierarchy and not wired directly to the host
controller. We don't necessarily have to implement all support for this
initially, but should have it in mind at least for the bindings.

Also we would probably lose the ability to use a sysfs attribute to
configure whether the hub should be always powered during suspend or
not. This could be worked around with a DT property, however DT
maintainers tend to be reluctant about configuration entries that
don't translate directly to the hardware.

I think at this point I should say that I can't personally commit to
implement such a solution in a foreseeable future due to other
commitments involved in shipping products. But I also want to make it
clear that as a project Chrome OS is interested in landing this
functionality upstream. I might be able to carve out some time, but it's
not certain. If not we will come back to this eventually, be it myself
or someone else on behalf of Chrome OS.
