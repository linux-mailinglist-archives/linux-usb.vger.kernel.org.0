Changed all the int values to be the correct size and using uN.

I am not sure what you mean by this, I should probably make the type
consistent between them, is that what you mean by "size"?

Yes, I switched to using just a mutex, I saw this being used in the
usb_skel driver. I was told earlier to remove the mutex and keep the
semaphore, but a mutex makes more sense to me as well.
Fixed 2 bugs along the way!

No, I will have to add something like `hwmon_pump_data` for pump informatio=
n.
This will also have to use fan/rpm hwmon interfaces so will share the same
channel range as `hwmon_fan_data`. This way I can just use channelnr as ind=
ex.
If I made pump a separate array/value(it's almost always one pump) I could =
no
longer just use channelnr as index.
If you are against this then I can change it, but it is a deliberate
choice to make it
void and not an accident.

The "flexible array member" seems to give little benefit over what I
am doing right
now. Since there are at most 3 fans and 1 pump in a realistic
configuration a static
array doesn't seem that bad actually.

I moved all the pwm values to u8, and a;ll rpm values to u16(as they
can't be any bigger)
I usually don't really write c code, all the different types for the
same thing confuse me in
which one to use.

Also moved to u8.

I put range checks around all input -> fan/pwm target conversions, if
you found any other
places let me know.

I could, but the only part that could actually be split up is the usb_bulk_=
msg.
If I would remove the error code that part could also be split up.
Are there any conventions around what to log/not to log? Maybe it is best t=
o
remove those log messages anyways.

Irrelevant since I moved to a fixed-size array.

Maybe?? I don't actually know, would take some debugging/wireshark to
figure out.
(there were some problems with wireshark and starting the windows
driver from what I
remember, so might not be possible to find out) by default it uses the
dafault profile
present in the driver. Only if another program interferes with the
device would this not
match.

I just made the name be part of the device config, this way its device
specific.

I knew I missed one of them! :(

Again I couldn't find anything on logging style within the kernel, I am lea=
ning
towards just removing them all together. If you can find any logging style
guide link me to it, if not I will just remove all the logs,

Just didn't know it existed.

Once you reply to my open comments I will send in V4,
if it's prefered to just add V4 not and address those comments later
let me know and I will just post them.

Kind regards,
