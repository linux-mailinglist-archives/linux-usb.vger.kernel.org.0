Very odd quoting style, perhaps you might want to read up on how to do
this properly at:

How does the kernel normally send error conditions that it detects in
hardware to userspace?

But you only have a single hub variable, and a huge memory leak, did you
not detect that in your testing?

Try it on a desktop as well, with many hubs and see what happens :(

What do you think should be done?

I don't think you are understanding that you can have multiple hubs in
the system at the same time :(
