Allowing the lowest level to operate even in S3 is only a small part of the puzzle, someone's got to provide data at some point. Unless the data is generated also by a side DSP having access to mass storage or wireless interfaces?

Thanks for the precision.

It was my understanding that anything above S1 could incur a hardware/software latency of two seconds or more to go back to S0. That would imply a buffering scheme that's significantly larger than usual offloaded solutions. In "typical" offload implementations it's rare to go beyond 100s of ms, since at some point you run into user-experience issues when applying volume changes or when changing tracks. It's usually a no-go if the user has to wait for a perceivable amount of time while the buffers drain.

Not to mention that quite a few platforms no longer support S3, since 'Modern Standby' aka "S0 Low Power Idle" or 's2idle' was introduced in the Windows 10 days S3 became largely a legacy feature gradually dropped since no one really uses it.
