I agree, this certainly looks more readable.

 From my understanding of qh_completions() if these "remaining" qTDs from
a short read are treated as !ACTIVE then none of the conditions in
!ACTIVE branch will hit: they don't have DBE or HALT set and they aren't
queue-stopping short read qTDs (I am assuming here that the
aforementioned qtd->hw_alt_next condition will be changed to exclude
them).

So the qTD processing loop will reach "if (last_status == -EINPROGRESS)",
this will be false since previous qTD (that one that has actually
partially completed) had already set the last_status to -EREMOTEIO.
Then the code will delete this qTD from qTD list and go to the next qTD
(either next "remaining" qTD from that URB or from a different URB).

Once a qTD from a different URB is encountered the special treatment of
ACTIVE qTDs as !ACTIVE has to end.

According to Microsoft docs every IRP that might remain queued for an
indefinite interval has to have a cancel handler.
URBs are submitted wrapped in IRPs, so at least in theory it should be
possible to cancel them.
But I don't know how it works in practice.

I also remember getting "warning: guest updated active QH" often when
launching Windows VMs in QEMU.
That does not seem like a good sign, but it might ultimately be a
deficiency in QEMU EHCI HC emulation, not Windows.

In Linux at least we could (theoretically) change the API and modify
all the client drivers.
But I think the benefit is not worth the cost at that point.

I've meant that these can exercise a different code path than ordinary
unlink so one has to check this, too.

That's great, thanks.

I agree, that's a bit unfortunate.

Unless one unlinks the qH temporarily (but as we have observed that's
rather slow) or disables the async list for a moment (probably slow,
too, and impacts other endpoints).

I see, thanks.

I think WRITE_ONCE() at least to the hw_token would make a lot of sense
here.
