The wakeup setting for USB hubs affects only the following events: port 
connect, port disconnect, and port overcurrent.  It does not refer to 
forwarding wakeup requests from downstream USB devices; that is always 
enabled.  So maybe your wakeup flag really is accurate and you didn't 
realize it.

The host controller's sysfs wakeup setting should always be correct.  If 
it isn't, that indicates there is a bug in the host controller driver or 
the corresponding platform-specific code.  What driver does your system 
use?
