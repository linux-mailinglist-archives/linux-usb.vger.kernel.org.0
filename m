It is in the log you posted:

[Mi Nov 3 11:55:23 2021] Bluetooth: hci0: Failed to send firmware data (-110)
[Mi Nov 3 11:55:23 2021] Bluetooth: hci0: sending frame failed (-19)

But this occurred after the timeout, so maybe you had in mind something 
occurring earlier.

While detecting the errors during URB completion would be nice, it isn't 
necessary.  Things would work just as well if the disconnect error were 
detected during submission of the following URB.
