Ah I see. So there will be another patch to do the park and unpark over
suspend/resume?

Oh sheesh. I thought that was being done already. It looks like at least
on sdm845 that there is only one parent for this clk so we don't need to
call clk_set_parent to set it there.

Sure, except some platforms don't have a mux?

I recall that qcom folks kept saying they needed to enable the
pipe_clk_src clk branch in GCC before enabling the phy. So they required
the halt skip flag so that the clk_prepare_enable() call would
effectively set the enable bit in GCC and move on without caring. Then
they could enable the upstream clk source in the phy without having to
stop halfway through to enable the branch in GCC. The whole design here
is pretty insane.

In fact, I think we discussed this whole topic in late 2019[1] and we
concluded that we could just slam the clk on forever and deal with the
clk_set_parent() when the clk became a mux+gate instead of a pure gate.

I guess it's fine? The GDSC will be on and the parent clk will already
be set so things are a no-op.
