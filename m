Then one would wonder why it has this declaration:
     struct scatterlist *sgl_alloc_order(unsigned long long length,
                                         unsigned int order, bool chainable,
                                         gfp_t gfp, unsigned int *nent_p)

'unsigned long long length' [in bytes] is a lot; 64 or 128 bits worth;
definitely more than 32 bits.

And vmalloc is declared:
     void *vmalloc(unsigned long size);

Which is 64 bits on a 64 bit machine (i.e. must be able hold a pointer).
And it is vmalloc() that I want to replace with sgl_alloc_order() in the
scsi_debug driver. Robert Love writes of vmalloc():

     "The vmalloc() function, to make nonphysically contiguous pages
     contiguous in the virtual address space, must specifically set up
     the page table entries. Worse, pages obtained via vmalloc() must
     be mapped by their individual pages (because they are not physically
     contiguous), which results in much greater TLB4 thrashing than you see
     when directly mapped memory is used. Because of these concerns,
     vmalloc() is used only when absolutely necessary—typically, to obtain
     large regions of memory." ['LK Development' 3rd edition, page 244]

And scatterlist seems to be doing in the foreground what vmalloc() is
doing in the background, but without those drawbacks.

My testing suggests using a store built with sgl_alloc_order() *** is a
little faster but with a lower standard deviation (i.e. spread) on timings
from repeated tests.

Another advantage of a scatterlist-based store in the scsi_debug driver
is that the data-in and data-out buffers associated with SCSI commands
also come through as scatterlist-based objects. Thus I can do almost all
the manipulations the driver needs to do to simulate a disk by adding
these general functions:
     - sgl_copy_sgl()
     - sgl_cmp_sgl()
     - sgl_memset()
     - sgl_prefetch()

A memmove() variant would be simple to implement, but the scsi_debug
driver doesn't need it.

I agree that one element of a scatter gather list should not exceed 4 GiB
of memory. In scsi_debug the scatter gather list (one per store) has
in some cases several thousand elements. But I do not agree that the _sum_
of the size of those elements should be limited to 4 GiB. With those two
lines removed from sgl_alloc_order() I can test an 8 GiB scsi_debug ram
disk on a 16 GiB machine. [I made it into 1 partition, did mkfs.ext4,
mounted it, rsync-ed the kernel source onto it and built a kernel that
runs. A reasonable test, no?]

*** the very useful property of sgl_alloc_order() is that each element
     of the scatter gather list has the same order (or it fails). This
     allows O(1) navigation of a big store like a 8 GiB ramdisk since
     sg_miter_skip() can be avoided with some simple integer maths.
