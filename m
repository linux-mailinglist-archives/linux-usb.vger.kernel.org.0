What if two devices are plugged into the hub, only one of them is 
runtime suspended, and you need to runtime resume that device?  Then you 
can't do a reset-resume of the hub, because the hub isn't suspended.

Yeah, I don't think very many hubs actually do that.

I'm not sure what you're proposing.

If (as mentioned above) the hub doesn't handle the 
Set-Port-Feature(suspend) request properly, then we should avoid issuing 
that request.  Which means runtime suspend attempts should not be 
allowed, as in your most recent patch.
