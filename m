We actually have not made any specific decision in that respect.  That
is, in the error path, the core will invoke the resume callbacks for
devices whose suspend callbacks were invoked and it won't do anything
beyond that because it has too little information on what would need
to be done.

Arguably, though, the failure case described above is not different
from regular resume during which the driver of A decides to retain the
device in runtime suspend.

I'm not sure if the core can do anything about it.

But at the time when the B's resume callback is invoked, runtime PM is
enabled for A, so the driver of B may as well use runtime_resume() to
resume the device if it wants to do so.  It may also decide to do
nothing like in the suspend callback.
