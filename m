Possible. Never thought about this.

If this is the case. Then we are currently dealing with way to much
durtion in the complete handler of the endpoints. I can't really
tell for the uac endpoints. But the uvc complete endpoint is going
through this roundtrip.

With no_interupt =3D 0 at every 16 request:

dwc3_endpoint_interrupt
   dwc3_gadget_endpoint_trbs_complete
     dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_completed_requests
~16 * {
         dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_completed_request
	  dwc3_gadget_giveback
	    usb_gadget_giveback_request
	      usb_ep_queue
	        __dwc3_gadget_ep_queue
		  dwc3_prepare_trbs
~ *	            {
                       dwc3_prepare_trbs_sg/dwc3_prepare_trbs_linear
		    }
		  dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd
       }

I think this is a lot of stack for an interrupt thread to handle if you
really want to pipeline this in one irqthread run and leave and make
sure that the other endpoints will also be handled soon enough.

To solve this issue I see two options:

We could either do this by having different interrupt threads per ep
like in this patch.

Or we ensure that the complete handler is not running that long.

This could be ensured by providing an interface that is similar to the
threaded interrupt interface. The complete handler should then only
wake up the corresponding complete thread.

This policy of a short running complete handler also should be commented
somewhere in the kernel.

Which brings me back to the open discussion with avichal, where I
already ment that it should be possible to completely remove the
usb_ep_queue callback from the complete handler. We there should only
update the buffer state and make sure that the pump worker would take
care of queueing the right buffers to the dwc3 driver. I will go more
into the details in this thread:

We should ensure that this chapter will be removed then.

Granted, but only if we ensure that the complete() callback is not
destroing the runtime duration and probably no usb_ep_queue is never
called from the complete callback.
