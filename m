Just thinking out loud here: This is before writing PCI_PM_CTRL.  The
device should be in D3hot and 0x100403 is PCI_COMMAND_IO |
PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY | PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE (and
PCI_STATUS_CAP_LIST), which mostly matches your lspci (it's missing
PCI_COMMAND_MASTER, but maybe that got turned off during suspend).
It's a little strange that PCI_COMMAND_IO is set because 03:00.3 has
no I/O BARs, but maybe that was set by BIOS at boot-time.

When you write D0 to PCI_PM_CTRL the device does a soft reset, so
pci_raw_set_power_state() delays before the next access.

When you read PCI_PM_CTRL again, I think you *should* get either
0x0000 (indicating that the device is in D0) or 0xffff (if the read
failed with a Config Request Retry Status (CRS) because the device
wasn't ready yet).

I can't explain why you would read 0x0003 (not 0xffff) from
PCI_PM_CTRL.

What happens if you do a dword read from PCI_VENDOR_ID here (after the
delay but before pci_dev_wait() or reading PCI_PM_CTRL)?

We have CRS "software visibility" enabled, and the expectation in the
spec is that software will read PCI_VENDOR_ID to see whether the
device is ready: 0x0001 means the read got a CRS completion (device
isn't ready), valid Vendor ID means device is ready, and 0xffff
indicates some other error.

pci_dev_wait() reads PCI_COMMAND, not PCI_VENDOR_ID, so maybe there's
some wrinkle in how that's handled.

You might also try changing pci_enable_crs() to disable
PCI_EXP_RTCTL_CRSSVE instead of enabling it to see if that makes any
difference.  CRS SV has kind of a checkered history and I'm a little
dubious about whether it buys us anything.

If PCI_COMMAND is non-zero at that point, I think something's wrong.
It should be zero by the time pci_raw_set_power_state() reads
PCI_PM_CTRL after the D3 delay.  By that time, we assume the reset has
happened and the device is in D0uninitialized and fully accessible.
