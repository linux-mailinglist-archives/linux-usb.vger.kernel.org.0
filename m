Look into it and see the differences, it's not hard to notice.

And the code samples are all up to date online on github somewhere,
there's people keeping them alive if you want to track them down, but
really, just look at the in-kernel drivers for better examples of real
drivers.

I am not going to create a study guide like this, sorry, I've already
given away the book for free to you :)

Please see the license of the book for what you are, and are not,
allowed to do with it to answer this question.
