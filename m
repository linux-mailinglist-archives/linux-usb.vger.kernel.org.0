#defines are trivial, and are good for documenting things.  We have loads
of drivers that do this to make it a good way to document the full
hardware or specification despite not using all of the defines.  They
also are not a maintenance burden.

I don't take new apis that no one uses in-kernel as that's just ripe for
deletion and is a maintenance burden.  It makes no sense to add and then
remove something right away :)
