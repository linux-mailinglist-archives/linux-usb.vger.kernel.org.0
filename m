We never should have had this split either in the DT binding nor
driver(s) as if the SoC wrapper crap and licensed IP block are
independent things. The thing to do here is either make the DWC3 code
a library which drivers call (e.g. SDHCI) or add hooks into the DWC3
driver for platform specifics (e.g. Designware PCI). Neither is a
simple solution though.
