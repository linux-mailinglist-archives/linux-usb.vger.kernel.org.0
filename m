Yes, my point is not to generalise. Agree that there are exceptions.

ACK. That's why I said "add comment" and not "check".

The rationale is that similarly to URB_FREE_BUFFER, this would be
optional. This is why I did not propose to reuse
URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP but instead add a new flag. I propose it
because I think that many drivers can benefit from it.

More than that, the real concern is that many developers forget to
free the DMA allocated memory. c.f. original message of this thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-can/alpine.DEB.2.22.394.2206031547001.1630869@thelappy/T/#m2ef343d3ee708178b1e37be898884bafa7f49f2f

And the usual fix requires to create local arrays to store references
to the transfer buffer and DMA addresses.

I would like to find a solution to remove this burden from the drivers
and have an USB API to easily free the URB when, for example, killing
an anchor.


Yours sincerely,
Vincent Mailhol
