Sure.

I don't grasp the point of this question.  It doesn't seem to be
relevant to the case you're concerned about -- your board isn't going to
wire up the special hub in this weird way, is it?

It certainly could be.  The platform-specific xhci suspend and resume
routines could power the hub on and off as needed, along with powering
the host controller.

_All_ of the handling could be done by xhci-plat.  Since the xHCI
controller is the parent of both the USB-2 and USB-3 incarnations of
the special hub, it won't get suspended until they are both in
suspend, and it will get resumed before either of them.  Similarly,
the power to the special hub could be switched on as part of the host
controller's probe routine and switched off during the host
controller's remove routine.

Using xhci-plat in this way would be better than a dedicated driver in
the sense that it wouldn't then be necessary to make up a fictitious
platform device and somehow describe it in DT.

The disadvantage is that we would end up with a driver that's
nominally meant to handle host controllers but now also manages (at
least in part) hubs.  A not-so-clean separation of functions.  But
that's not terribly different from the way your current patch works,
right?
