Yes, same as on any other architecture that supports more than one
platform at a time.

There are only about five chip vendors for x86-64, and they largely
just use the same drivers. You still have platform support that you need to
enable to run on all machines, see:

CONFIG_X86_NUMACHIP
CONFIG_X86_VSMP
CONFIG_X86_UV
CONFIG_X86_GOLDFISH
CONFIG_X86_INTEL_CE
CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MID
CONFIG_X86_AMD_PLATFORM_DEVICE
CONFIG_KVM_GUEST
CONFIG_JAILHOUSE_GUEST
CONFIG_ACRN_GUEST
CONFIG_CHROME_PLATFORMS
CONFIG_MELLANOX_PLATFORM
CONFIG_SURFACE_PLATFORMS
laptop vendors in drivers/platform/x86/Kconfig

Most of these have only a few drivers, while none of the interesting
x86 platforms that modified from ARM or MIPS SoCs
(Allwinner/Rockchip Sofia, Unisoc SC9861G-IA, Maxlinear
XWAY, MobilEye EyeQ6) made it upstream so far, and probably
never will.

It is very intentional that there is only one defconfig, this helps ensure
that none of the platform specific drivers conflicts with other platforms.

Basing on the CPU type seems way crazier to me, these have
almost nothing to do with what kind of drivers one gets to use.

SoC designers rarely care much about the CPU core they put
in a SoC, they just license a part fits their needs.
At the moment everyone is using ARM, but before that they had
the same platforms on powerpc, mips, sh, or their own custom
architecture. Some get acquired by Intel and start using x86
cores, and some others move to RISC-V.
