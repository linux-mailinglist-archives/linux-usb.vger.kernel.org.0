Correct, but people don't go around unloading modules (unlike probe
deferral which anyone can hit). It's a development (debugging) feature
so there being some corner cases are not that big of a deal.

Changing the trigger type during runtime depending on use-case should be
fine. It just doesn't play well with the kernel's interrupt mapping
code, which assumes that if an interrupt already has a mapping then it
is a shared interrupt.

I considered addressing that in the core code, but yeah, I don't want
too much time since the remaining issue only affects module unload and
there are other ways to avoid that issue too.

Yes, that is how it is currently implemented and I intend to change that
shortly. I just wanted to get the fixes out first.

Specifically, I consider the current implementation to be broken in that
it generates wakeup events on disconnect which is generally not want you
want. Consider closing the lid of your laptop and disconnecting a USB
mouse before putting it in your backpack. Now it's no longer suspended
as you would expect it to be.

With the devictrees soon fixed, we could also do away with changing the
trigger type, but since this is how it was implemented initially we now
need to consider backward compatibility with the broken DTs. We've dealt
with that before, but yeah, getting things right from the start would
have been so much better.
