There is one detail here that I missed, sorry about that.

Actually, the core can only set the runtime status to "active" for
devices where dev_pm_skip_suspend() returns 'true'.

First, if the device is not "suspended", its status is "active" already
anyway.

Second, if the device has SMART_SUSPEND clear, the driver may not expect
its runtime status to change from "suspended" to "active" during system-wide
resume-type transitions (the driver's system-wide PM callbacks may use
the runtime status to determine what to do and changing the status this
way may confuse that).

[Actually, the drivers that set neither SMART_SUSPEND nor MAY_SKIP_RESUME
 may not expect the runtime status to change during system-wide resume-type
 transitions at all, but there is the corner case when the driver can set
 MAY_SKIP_RESUME without setting SMART_SUSPEND.  In that case its "noirq"
 and "early" resume callbacks may be skipped and then it should expect
 the runtime status to sometimes change from "active" to "suspended" during
 RESUME transitions, but it may still not expect to see changes the other way
 around, as in that case all of its callbacks are going to be invoked and
 apply the internal runtime status handling mentioned above.]

So overall:

  At the start of the {resume,thaw,restore}_noirq phase, if
  dev_pm_skip_resume() returns true ,then the core will set the
  runtime status to "suspended".  Otherwise, if dev_pm_skip_suspend()
  also returns true, then the core will set the runtime status to "active".
  If this is not what the subsystem or driver wants, it must update the
  runtime status itself.

I'm assuming that you refer to the scenario below.

That cannot happen, because dev_pm_smart_suspend() also returns 'false' for B
and so its runtime status will not be changed to "active".

AFAICS, this particular one is not an issue.

BTW, I have updated my pm-sleep-core branch to reflect what appears to be
the current state-of-the-art to me.

I'm going to post a v2 of this patch series over the weekend for reference.

Cheers!
