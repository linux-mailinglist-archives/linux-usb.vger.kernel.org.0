Add an intro sentence to tell us what this patch does (mark USB4

read the commit log separately and it should be complete in itself.
A title is not the first sentence of a book.

s/Downstream drivers/Drivers of downstream devices/
s/performed/perform/  (I guess?)

I'm guessing this really refers to differences in how *devices*
(not drivers) perform when they are below a Thunderbolt or USB port.

I've never liked "is_thunderbolt" because it tells us nothing about
what functionality is of interest, so it's an unmaintainable mess.

Right now:

  - We assume Root Ports and Switch Ports marked "is_thunderbolt"
    support D3 (pci_bridge_d3_possible()).

  - Downstream Ports marked "is_thunderbolt" don't support native
    hotplug Command Completed events, even if they claim they do
    (pcie_init()).

  - Apparently, if *any* device in the system is marked
    "is_thunderbolt", a GPU external DP port is not fully switchable
    because ? (gmux_probe()).

  - Whether an AMD GPU is attached via Thunderbolt tells us something
    about what sort of power control and runtime power management we
    can do (amdgpu_driver_load_kms(), radeon_driver_load_kms()).

  - We don't register Thunderbolt eGPU devices with VGA switcheroo
    because ? (nouveau_vga_init(), radeon_device_init()).

  - If an AMD GPU is attached via Thunderbolt, we program different
    ASPM time values because ? (nbio_v2_3_enable_aspm()).

This is totally bonkers.

Broken things like hotplug Command Completed should be quirks.  That
one is my fault.

The ASPM thing should be integrated with the PCI core somehow.  It's
just asking for trouble to have the PCI core assuming *it* is managing
ASPM and then have drivers doing non-standard ASPM stuff behind its
back.

I have no idea about the VGA switching and power management stuff.

But it's not clear to me that these all fit under the "is_thunderbolt"
umbrella.  If they actually do correspond to Thunderbolt- or USB4-
specific features, we should include references to the pertinent
sections of the spec.

This could be rewritten as:

  if (dev->class == PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_USB_USB4 ||
      pci_find_vsec_capability(dev, PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_VSEC_ID_INTEL_TBT))
          dev->is_thunderbolt = 1;

to avoid searching USB4 devices for a TBT capability unnecessarily.
