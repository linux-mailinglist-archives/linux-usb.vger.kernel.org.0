No, they don't contradict.

I am perfectly fine with (and like it!) putting dwc3 exynos back into 
base/main dwc3  and getting rid of USB_DWC3_EXYNOS entirely. But this 
was not part of this patch...

At least with Samsung serial driver we see adding new SoC - Apple M1.

Here, the guys in Samsung want to tweak several kernel parts to work 
with their out-of-tree code without contributing this code back. It's 
not a community-friendly approach. The upstream kernel should be tweaked 
to the out-of-tree unknown, hidden and uncontrollable code.

Instead I expect from Samsung to contribute the basic Exynos9 support to 
the upstream.
