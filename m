All right, those are some significant changes.  It'll take me a little 
while to absorb them.

[Let's confine this discussion to the not-direct-complete case.]

Okay, say that SMART_SUSPEND isn't set and the device is initially
runtime-suspended.  Since the core knows all this, shouldn't the core 
then call pm_runtime_resume() immediately before ->suspend?  Why leave 
this up to subsystems or drivers (which can easily get it wrong -- 
not to mention all the code duplication it would require)?

Also, doesn't it make sense for some subsystems or drivers to want 
their devices to remain in runtime suspend throughout a FREEZE/THAW 
transition but not throughout a SUSPEND/RESUME transition?  With only a 
single SMART_SUSPEND flag, how can we accomodate this desire?

Finally, my description above says that LEAVE_SUSPENDED matters for 
SUSPEND/RESUME but not for FREEZE/THAW.  Is that really what you have 
in mind?

This is inconsistent with what I wrote above (the "Unless SMART_SUSPEND
and LEAVE_SUSPENDED are both set" part).  Are you saying that text
should be changed?

Well, that's not really a fair description.  The decision about
skipping driver-level callbacks is being made right here, by us, now.  
(Or if you prefer, by the developers who originally added the
SMART_SUSPEND flag.)  We require subsystems to obey the decisions being
outlined in this discussion.

Given that fact, this is again a case of having the core do something 
rather than forcing subsystems/drivers to do it (possibly getting it 
wrong and certainly creating a lot of code duplication).

If a subsystem really wants to override our decision, it can always
call pm_runtime_set_{active|suspended} to override the core's setting.

This seems to contradict what you wrote above: "Drivers may expect
devices to be runtime-active when their suspend callbacks are invoked
unless they set SMART_SUSPEND.  IOW, without SMART_SUSPEND set the
device should not be left in runtime suspend during system-wide suspend
at all unless direct-complete is applied to it."

If you stand by that statement then drivers should never point their
suspend callback to pm_runtime_force_suspend() unless they also set
SMART_SUSPEND.
