Hi Martin,

thanks for the comment.

1, G12A have usb2-phy0/usb2-phy1/usb3-phy0 three phys and an interrupt to support host/peripheral/otg modes.
   A1 has one usb2-phy0 phy and only support host mode.
   
2, G12A glue/phy drivers are for G12A SoCs, there are some diffrences to A1.
   G12A glue driver have dr_mode and interrupts two attributes to support otg mode while A1 hasn't this requirement.
   G12A glue driver has a hard coding vbus regulator code to support otg mode while A1 hasn't this requirement.
   G12A glue driver has a hard coding support phys while A1 only supports host mode.
   	enum {
		USB2_HOST_PHY = 0,
		USB2_OTG_PHY,
		USB3_HOST_PHY,
		PHY_COUNT,
		};
   G12A glue driver only supports one clock while A1 needs four clocks.
   G12A and A1 phy drivers have different register configurations since hardware differences.
   
3, We have estimated these differences and we thought it's more clear and readable to have a dedicated glue/phy
   driver for A1 SoCs, so also dedicated dt-bindings.
