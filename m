I need to be more clear here about the word 'Generic' that I've used.

This is not a OS-agnostic protocol. It's written for Linux. I have had
the BSD's in mind, hence the MIT license, FreeBSD for instance has a DRM
subsystem. Other OS'es might not support all DRM properties, but should
be able to use it as a basic display. They will ofc need to translate
the Linux DRM specifics into their own environment. But first and
foremost this is for Linux.

The host driver is written against the capabilities of the Linux gadget
framework and the DRM subsystem. This will add some peculiarities that a
microcontroller implementation won't face. The focal point of the
project is providing as good performance as possible for Full HD desktop
use.

The word 'Generic' means that it's (should be) possible to make a USB
display for use on Linux without having to write a graphics driver. This
includes all kinds of tiny/small displays that currently are SPI or I2C
interfaced. These will probably use a microcontroller instead of a Linux
SoC to keep cost low.

Performance is not good without compression so I need to keep that.

The kernel supports it and in actually performs quite well.
Decompression is much faster than compression which fits nicely with not
so powerful USB devices. Low resolution displays might not need
compression at all.

Could be, it's possible to support other compression methods. I'll leave
that to the professionals that need it for their display.

The DRM subsystem doesn't have support for it so the gadget wouldn't
know when to use it. Monochrome DRM drivers advertise a XRGB8888 format
and converts this into monochrome. The reason for using this format is
because all userspace supports it. AFAIK no DRM userspace support
monochrome.

I have done a microcontroller implementation, so I have tried it. It's
quite a different environment to work in than Linux for sure :-) It
might have been a more pleasant experience if I'd spent money on a
professional compiler/IDE I guess.

That can't happen AFAIK. This would require the driver to probe all USB
devices with a vendor interface. Who knows what kind a havoc this might
cause on the device in question.

I can consider a driver that looks at all vendor interfaces if you can
find a driver in the kernel that does this.

Ok, if this is really confusing I need to fix it and I couldn't find a
driver to support my case in the kernel either.

>>>> +static int gud_usb_get_status(struct usb_device *usb, u8 ifnum)

I'm skipping the status poll discussion since I've discovered a bug in
my previous code that broke on timeouts. I will to try and fix that
first and see how it turns out.

The start of the buffer is word aligned to match the arch, the memory
subsystem takes care of that, otherwise we would have all kinds of trouble.

I'm sorry but that's outside of the scope of the project and the effort

I wanted to see if you were going to use R1 in the near future,
otherwise I will remove this in the next version. I guess I'll fix this
if it stays.

Those are properties exposed by the DRM subsystem for use on TV
connectors. I actually don't know much details, I've just exposed them
and tested that I can set margins.

I disagree, I believe this is generic, within the Linux world.
