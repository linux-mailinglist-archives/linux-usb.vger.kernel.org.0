I can throw a few hints which might be helpful.

First, you should obviously prepare two versions of the gs_usb driver:
one using usb_alloc_coherent() (the current one), the other using
kmalloc() and compare the two.

Right now, I can think of two relevant benchmarks: transmission
latency and CPU load.

For the transmission latency, I posted one on my tools:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-can/20220626075317.746535-1-mailhol.vincent@wanadoo.fr/T/#u

For the CPU load, I suggest to put the bus on full load, for example using:
| cangen -g0 -p1 can0
(you might also want to play with other parameters such as the length using -L)
Then use an existing tool to get the CPU load figures. I don't know
for sure which tool is a good one to benchmark CPU usage in kernel
land so you will have to research that part. If anyone has a
suggestion…

Yes, I looked at the log, the very first CAN USB driver is ems_usb and
was using DMA memory from the beginning. From that point on, nearly
all the drivers copied the trend (the only exception I am aware of is
peak_usb).

I agree that the scope is wider than the gs_can (thus my proposal to
fix it at API level).


Yours sincerely,
