As Wesley pointed out, the lock can be released during giveback and 
requests can be added to the cancelled_list at that time.

On the other hand, if that happens, do you need to process those 
requests in this function call?  Will another cleanup iteration take 
care of them later?  (I don't know the driver well enough to answer 
this.)  If it will, you may not need to restart anything.

I don't see why anything like that would be necessary.  Giving back 
cancelled requests isn't important enough to warrant special treatment.

An alternative approach, used by some other drivers, is to stick with 
list_for_each_entry_safe as in the existing code, but go back to the 
restart label immediately each time the lock is released and reacquired.

Also, if this loop always removes the entry it is processing from the 
list (I don't know whether it does this), you don't have to use 
list_for_each_entry_safe.  You can simply use list_first_entry.
