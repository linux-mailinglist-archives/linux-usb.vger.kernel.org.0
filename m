Dear Friend,

I assume that this message will reach you in good health.  I m Mrs. Kish
Patrick, the wife of late kano Patrick,  the Director of High River Gold
Mines Ltd Burkina Faso West Africa. Now I am suffering from breast cancer
and from all indication, I understand that I am not going to survive this 
sickness. Therefore, i need a reliable person, who will handle this
project accordingly, accomplish  my heart desire and utilize this fund. I
assured you honesty and reliability to champion this  business
opportunity. I have decided to donate the sum Twenty-Five Million Two
Hundred Thousand  United State Dollars Only  ($25,200,000.00) to Charity
Organizations or to support the Orphans,  Motherless Babies, Less
privileged and free Medical & Medicine Poor People's around the World
since  I don t have any child and do not want the bank to take over the
fund. If you are ready  handle this transaction, i will guide you on how
you should apply for the claim so that the fund will release into your own
account and  you will take 40% from the fund and the rest will use for
Charity Organizations. Further information will be given to you as soon as
I receive your reply.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Regard
Mrs.Kish Patrick.
