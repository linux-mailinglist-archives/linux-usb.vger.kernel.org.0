Kai's point is that the xhci-hcd driver thinks the device is now in 
runtime suspend, because the runtime_suspend method has been executed.  
But in fact the device is still in D0, and as a result, PME signalling 
may not work correctly.

On the other hand, it wasn't clear from the patch description whether
this actually causes a problem on real systems.  The description only
said that the problem was theoretical.

According to Kai, PME signalling doesn't work in D0 -- or at least, it
is _documented_ not to work in D0 -- even though it is enabled and the
device claims to support it.

In any case, I don't really see any point in "runtime suspending" a 
device while leaving it in D0.  We might as well just leave it alone.
