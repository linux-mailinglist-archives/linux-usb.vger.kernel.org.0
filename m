For some reason the driver core only runtime resumes a device on unbind
(in __device_release_driver()), but not on bind (in driver_probe_device()).

However, the PCI core makes up for that by runtime resuming the device
in local_pci_probe().

Yes to both questions.

Could you try to bisect the issue?

Thanks,
