The O.E.D. defines these terms:

	residual
	a. [...]
	n. 1. a quantity remaining after other things have been subtracted 
	      or allowed for. [...]
	   2. [...]
	   3. [...]

and

	residue
	n. a small amount of something that remains after the main part 
	   has gone or been taken or used.


So, writing "residue" could be misleading as the connotation is that the 
remaining part is the lesser part.

I think that's probably why the term "residual" gets used in finance (and 
in SCSI transfers).
