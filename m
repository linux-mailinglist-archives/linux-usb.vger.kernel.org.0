Agreed with the above.

Or MAY_SKIP_RESUME is unset (which means that the driver does not
allow its resume callbacks to be skipped), or power.may_skip_resume
is unset (which means that the subsystem does not allow the
driver callbacks to be skipped).

The other way around.  That is:

dev_pm_skip_resume() will return "true" if the current transition is
THAW and dev_pm_skip_suspend() returns "true" for that device (so
SMART_SUSPEND is set, and the device's runtime status is "suspended",
as per the definition of that function above).

Otherwise, it will return "true" if the current transition is RESTORE
(which means that all devices are resumed) or power.must_resume is not
set (so this particular device need not be resumed).

Unless MAY_SKIP_RESUME is unset for at least one of its descendants (or
dependent devices).

And if the device was not in active use before suspend (as per its usage
counter) or MAY_SKIP_RESUME is unset for at least one of its descendants (or
dependent devices in general).

Right.

IMO we should.

Otherwise it is rather hard to catch the case in which one of the
device's descendants has MAY_SKIP_RESUME unset (and so the device
needs to be resumed).

Well, we don't seem to have reached an agreement on some details
above ...

Cheers!
