Thanks for testing it.

I'm still not sure that the PPM is the culprit here. I have a feeling
that the problem you are seeing is caused by the workaround (bad
workaround) that we have for the issue where the EC firmware does not
return with the BUSY bit set in the CCI when it should in many cases.
The UCSI ACPI driver has one minute timeout value for command
completion because of that, which is way too long. So if the EC
firmware decides to take its time before acknowledging command, the
driver is stuck, and we start loosing the events... Well, I guess
technically the PPM would be the culprit in the end in any case, but
I'm just not sure that there is any race like you suspected.

But this is off topic. I'll send you an RFC proposal what I think we
could do about that.


thanks,
