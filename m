After a quick review, I don't see anything wrong with this series, nice
work.

It does feel odd you need to split things into a "common" and then 2
other modules, but I guess it makes sense.  Worst case, over time, you
merge them back together after everyone just ends up enabling both of
them :)

Felipe, want me to take these directly, or should they go through your
tree after you review them?  I never remember with this driver whose it
goes through.

thanks,
