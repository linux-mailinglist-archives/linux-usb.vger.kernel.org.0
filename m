Is that a USB device?  That is, does it connect to the computer 
via a USB cable?  I'll assume it does...

Given only the information you have provided, it is impossible to 
answer that question.  Broadly speaking, lots of bugs in the USB 
subsystem have been fixed since kernel 5.3.18, but I don't know 
if any of them would affect detecting new devices on the bus like 
this.

One thing you might try is to turn on USB debugging before 
plugging in the device:

echo 'module usbcore =p' >/sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

The additional information this adds to the dmesg log may be 
helpful.
