Ok, if this is when the system is not running, why does Linux need to be
involved at all?

And if Linux is running, why not just follow the USB spec and not create
your own craziness?

So it does follow the spec?  Or does not?  I can't determine here.

If the EC is in charge of all of this, why does Linux need to get
involved?

Why would you have DT involved if you are using acpi?  :)
