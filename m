I haven't had time to look through it yet.

maxburst is a USB-3 thing.  It mainly affects just throughput, not 
functionality, and it's handled pretty much entirely by the hardware.  
You shouldn't worry about it, at least, not now.

I don't think there are any significant attributes for ep0.  In
general, gadget drivers have to live with what the hardware supports --
or else fail to run at all.  After all, the driver can't substitute a 
different endpoint for ep0.
