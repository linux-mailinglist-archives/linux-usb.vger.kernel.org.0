IMO I think the user should have the ability to choose whether or not to enable the offload path, since there are a lot of different USB audio devices in the market.  Obviously, the audio DSP will try its best to support every device we check for, but there might be a few outliers that may behave differently.  In addition, the code complexity that would be involved in bridging the PCM device exposed by USB SND into ASoC will be much more invasive to SND core code.  At least as of now, if the offload code is added, and userspace doesn't know anything about it, then the default USB SND path is taken and that won't break any current userspace applications.

Now, if we go and add some kernel based offload routing, and forcing that onto every userspace application, and we break that use case, that would be a problem.  In the end, I think if userspace wants to enable offloading they should need to have some changes implemented to account for it.  In discussions with Pierre, maybe enabling the offload path can be on a policy based condition, such as a "low power/power aware" audio path, and not something that is always enabled.

Thanks

> With current design there are _two_ separate FEs, on _two_ separate cards, which are linked by kcontrol and which block each other. I'm rather confused how basic userspace application knows which one to use in this case. (By now of course I know that it needs to read kcontrol to see if and where it is offloaded and then open the FE on the card, but in my opinion it is unnecessarily convoluted.)

It is adding more work on userspace side, which will require special handling to work correctly.
