Awesome, as mentioned, the endpoint feature flags were added exactly to
allow for these vendor-specific features :-)

I'm more than happy to help testing now that I finally got our SM8150
Surface Duo device tree accepted by Bjorn ;-)

do you mind testing with the regular request size (16KiB) and 250
requests? I think we can even do 15 bursts in that case.

I remember getting close to 400MiB/sec with Intel platforms without
resizing FIFOs and I'm sure the FIFO size was set to 2x1024, though my
memory could be failing.

Then again, I never ran with CrystalDiskMark, I was using my own tool
(it's somewhere in github. If you care, I can look up the URL).

loopback iperf? That would skip the wire, no?

Hmm, that's not what I remember. Perhaps the TRB cache size plays a role
here too. I have clear memories of testing this very scenario of
bursting (using g_mass_storage at the time) because I was curious about
it. Back then, my tests showed no difference in behavior.

It could be nice if Heikki could test Intel parts with and without your
changes on g_mass_storage with 250 requests.

Yes and no. Looking back at the history, we used to configure NUMP based
on bMaxBurst, but it was changed later in commit
4e99472bc10bda9906526d725ff6d5f27b4ddca1 by yours truly because of a
problem reported by John Youn.

And now we've come full circle. Because even if I believe more requests
are enough for bursting, NUMP is limited by the RxFIFO size. This ends
up supporting your claim that we need RxFIFO resizing if we want to
squeeze more throughput out of the controller.

However, note that this is about RxFIFO size, not TxFIFO size. In fact,
looking at Table 8-13 of USB 3.1 r1.0, we read the following about NumP
(emphasis is mine):

	"Number of Packets (NumP). This field is used to indicate the
	number of Data Packet buffers that the **receiver** can
	accept. The value in this field shall be less than or equal to
	the maximum burst size supported by the endpoint as determined
	by the value in the bMaxBurst field in the Endpoint Companion
	Descriptor (refer to Section 9.6.7)."

So, NumP is for the receiver, not the transmitter. Could you clarify
what you mean here?

/me keeps reading

Hmm, table 8-15 tries to clarify:

	"Number of Packets (NumP).

	For an OUT endpoint, refer to Table 8-13 for the description of
	this field.

	For an IN endpoint this field is set by the endpoint to the
	number of packets it can transmit when the host resumes
	transactions to it. This field shall not have a value greater
	than the maximum burst size supported by the endpoint as
	indicated by the value in the bMaxBurst field in the Endpoint
	Companion Descriptor. Note that the value reported in this field
	may be treated by the host as informative only."

However, if I remember correctly (please verify dwc3 databook), NUMP in
DCFG was only for receive buffers. Thin, John, how does dwc3 compute
NumP for TX/IN endpoints? Is that computed as a function of DCFG.NUMP or
TxFIFO size?

Unfortunately I don't have access to a USB sniffer anymore :-(

okay, great. Let's see what John and/or Thinh respond WRT dwc3 TX Burst
behavior.
