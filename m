Hi Rob,

Sure, I will add a reference to that doc.

I reviewed the connector binding previously, and couldn't seem to come
up with a model which fit a design where the type C controller (ie the
entity which does the CC orientation and role detection) does not have
the SS lane mux included.  The SS lane mux is the HW which handles the
selection of the SS lanes to utilize based on cable orientation.

I looked at the FUSB302 TCPM driver, which doesn't have an integrated SS
lane mux, and relies on an external FUSB340 switch to handle the
polarity, but seems that in the fusb302.c driver it doesn't implement
the polarity handler.  They might possibly have a HW output signal which
controls the mux directly, but I'm not sure on that.

Anyway, if someone wanted to take a SW approach and program an external
mux, this model doesn't seem to allow that.  This is somewhat unrelated
to the DP AUX mode switching, as that probably will only come into the
picture after the policy engine has detected there is a DP adapter
connected, whereas this is applicable to non DP/alt mode situations.

Thanks!
