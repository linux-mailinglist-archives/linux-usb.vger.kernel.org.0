Could you provide more details?
1. Is the connection in PD3 ?
2. Could you provide the tcpm logs?

Either Sink/UFP or Source/DFP in the beginning. Then DR_SWAP is okay
when both ports are in ready state. Your dock looks like a Sourcing
Device.

Type-C Spec:
```
4.8.4 Sourcing Device

A Sourcing Device is a special sub-class of a DRP that is capable of
supplying power, but is not capable of acting as a USB host. For
example a hub=E2=80=99s UFP or a monitor=E2=80=99s UFP that operates as a d=
evice but
not as a host.

The Sourcing Device shall follow the rules for a DRP (See Section
4.5.1.4 and Figure 4-15). It shall also follow the requirements for
the Source as Power Source (See Section 4.8.1). The Sourcing Device
shall support USB PD and shall support the DR_Swap command in order to
enable the Source to assume the UFP data role.
```
