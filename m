Ah, nice, thanks for showing me this! I had written my own parser that
just dumped a few register names and what bits were set in each, but
your script seems much more feature-complete.

Thanks for the in-depth explanation, I find these low-level details
really fascinating.

Ah, I see. Do you know if the information on the PEST registers is
documented publicly somewhere? I tried searching for what those
registers meant in the PHB4 spec but it basically just said, "the PEST
registers contain PEST data," which isn't particularly helpful.

Thanks, iommu=nobypass fixed it! Plugging in one or more USB devices
no longer triggers any EEH errors.

Yup, the xhci driver has a quirks system, and conveniently one of
those is XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT. After making a 3-line patch to
xhci-pci.c to add that quirk for this chip, the host controller is now
able to work without setting iommu=nobypass in the kernel arguments.

Thank you so much for your help! You've likely saved me several hours
of reading documentation, as well as several more hours of fiddling
around with the xhci driver. I'm almost disappointed the fix was so
simple, but the time savings alone more than makes up for it. I'll
submit the patch to the USB ML shortly.

Thanks again!

Forest
