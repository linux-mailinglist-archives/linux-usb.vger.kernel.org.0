in fact, I want to consider all non-UsbOperational state for my patch, 
as for UsbSuspend state and my issue that

your advice is the pefect solution, and apply for the change according 
to your advice, it can fix my problem by my test.

in addition, I got the non-UsbOperationnal state was by read hcfs bits 
in ohci control register, for the UsbSuspend status that

it is only changed in ohci_rh_suspend. and other states was changed in 
multiple place that seems disable sof interrupt was only

in ohci_irq. but if you still think it  has risk i want to following 
your advice and as it v5 version.

Hi Alan stern,

     I have a try that follow your advice and the s3/s4 test result is 
good for me.


Thanks,
