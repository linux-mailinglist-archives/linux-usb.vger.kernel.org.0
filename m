You should include this information in the patch description, so that 
people will understand why you wrote the patch.

What's wrong with the existing implementation?  Are you talking about 
the do_read_toc function?  The driver only supports one session in any 
case.

In general, fixes to existing code and additions of new code should go 
in separate patches.
