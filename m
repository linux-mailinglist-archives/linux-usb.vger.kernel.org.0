No, this isn't necessarily true at all.  Allocations are fast, and if we
free/allocate things quickly, it's even faster.  USB is limited by the
hardware throughput, which is _very_ slow compared to memory accesses of
the allocator.

So unless you can show that we are using less CPU time, or something
else "real" that is measurable in a real way in userspace, that would
justify the extra complexity, it's going to be hard to get me to agree
that this is something that needs to be addressed at all.

Also, I'm totally confused as to what the "latest" version of this
patchset is...
