Its not just dev vs sysdev, its iface->dev vs bus->sysdev, and I assume
that the latter is actually the XHCI controller.

my vote goes to reverting to avoid the regression for 5.10, esp. since
this is a clean revert of 3 patches with nothing depending / building
on top of the reverted commits.

Then for 5.11 we can retry to introduce similar changes. I would be happy
to try a new patch-set for 5.11.

I'm not very familiar with all the DMA mapping / mask code, but AFAIK making
changes to the DMA settings of a child will not influence the parent.

Where as when passing bus->sysdev, then changes are made to a device
which is shared with other devices on the bus, which is why we see
a regression in an USB NIC driver being triggered by the UAS driver
binding to a device (on the same bus).

At least that is my interpretation of this. I bisected the regression
and that pointed at the UAS DMA change and reverting it fixes things,
confirming that I did not make any mistakes during the bisect.

Regards,

Hans
