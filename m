I think there's a desire to model USB ports as connector child nodes of 
a USB controllers as opposed to the more generic extcon so, I think the 
effort should probably be made to model it up as typec.

1. Model as a typec connector
    You can use usb-role-switch based on the VBUS interrupt you get
    drivers/extcon/extcon-axp288.c::axp288_usb_role_work()
    as an exmple

2. Model the registers/gpios in the PMIC interface as regulators
    that your typec driver could then own.

    You wouldn't have to notify outside of your typec driver then
    you'd just be using the regulator API.

You can use regmap to divide up the registers between devices for that.

Can that work for you ?

Reading the dts that goes with this

+The EUD (Embedded USB Debugger) is a mini-USB hub implemented
+on chip to support the USB-based debug and trace capabilities.

Ah so, the EUD is a mux, that sits between the connector and the 
controller, routing UTMI signals to an internal USB hub, which in-turn 
has debug functions attached to the hub...

Can the Arm core see the hub ? I assume not ?

There are a few different modes - you should probably be clear on which 
mode it is you are supporting.

Normal mode: (Bypass)
Port | EUD | Controller

Normal + debug hub mode: (Debug)
Port | EUD | Controller + HUB -> debug functions

Debug hub mode: (Control Peripheral)
Port | EUD | HUB -> debug functions

its not clear to me from the documentation or the code which mode it is 
we are targeting to be supported here.

I think you should support Debug mode only here, so that the Arm core 
never has to deal with the situation where the USB connector "goes away".

If we were to support Control Peripheral where the local DWC3 controller 
has the signals routed away entirely, then I think we would need to look 
into modelling that in device tree - and using an overlay to show the 
DWC3 controller going away in Control Peripheral mode and coming back.

Also final thought since the EUD can operate in different modes, it 
really should be a string that gets passed in - with the string name 
aligning to the documentation "bypass", "debug" and so on, so that the 
mode we are switching to is obvious to anybody who has the spec and the 
driver.
