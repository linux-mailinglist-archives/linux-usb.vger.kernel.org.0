That's my point, the same one as it would use doing normal 
playback/capture on systems which don't have Offload.

If I attach USB Headphones, as a user my expectation would be to use 
playback FE on USB card it exposes, not to spend time setting some 
controls and telling it to use some FE from other card.

With current design there are _two_ separate FEs, on _two_ separate 
cards, which are linked by kcontrol and which block each other. I'm 
rather confused how basic userspace application knows which one to use 
in this case. (By now of course I know that it needs to read kcontrol to 
see if and where it is offloaded and then open the FE on the card, but 
in my opinion it is unnecessarily convoluted.)

And "offloading" decision to the user/sound server/HAL doesn't help in 
my opinion.

That's the point, currently there needs to be some guesswork involved, 
because you need to check kcontrols to see if the endpoint can be 
offloaded and open the other FE it points at, instead of directly 
opening the one you usually would, and having it Offloaded by kernel. It 
is adding more work on userspace side, which will require special 
handling to work correctly.

Yes and with the description above it would be just one of the checks 
after which it would decide that it can't do Offload on capture path and 
open it in standard way, I see no problem?

In my opinion even if it is specific use case, there is no reason to 
make it more complicated than it needs to be. From my point of view 
problem with current design is that instead of being mostly transparent 
to userspace (when it could be), it adds more work for it.
