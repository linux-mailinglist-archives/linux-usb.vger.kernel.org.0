OK, looks like the changes made to the (now-recently-released) 6.11 have 
fixed all the suspend/resume issues.

... and it turns out that my crashes on the CalDigit TB4 dock are 
probably related to a Thunderbolt-to-NVMe enclosure that was always 
plugged into to the dock; apparently when resuming "something" was 
waiting for the now-disconnected NVMe drive to come back, leading to the 
hangs. Disconnecting the enclosure from the dock seems to prevent the 
resume crashes.

I may try and root-cause that issue later, if I have time.

I guess we can call the Subject: issue mostly-solved.
