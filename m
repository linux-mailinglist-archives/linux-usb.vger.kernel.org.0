I really think you need to explain the patch at least a little.
Consider people who don't understand that much about USB PD. Open it
up somehow instead of just quoting the spec.

Can you please start by explaining what exactly is TDA 2.2.1.1 and TDA
2.2.1.2. Perhaps you could also consider a better subject line for
this?

thanks,
