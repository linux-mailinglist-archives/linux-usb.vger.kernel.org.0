This discussion is still not right.

> When OHCI enters the S4 sleep state,

To start with, you should be talking about hibernation (also known as 
suspend-to-disk), not S4.  When the system enters hibernation -- for 
example, when you write "disk" to /sys/power/state -- the controller may 
go into S4 or it may go into some other power-saving state.

This isn't true.  The procedure _does_ call ohci_suspend, through the 
.poweroff callback in hcd-pci.c.  That callback goes to the 
hcd_pci_suspend routine, which calls suspend_common and then 
ohci_suspend.

However, these calls happen after the kernel image has be written to the 
storage area on the disk.  As a result, any log messages produced during 
the calls do not get saved, so they don't get reloaded when the system 
resumes from hibernation, and they aren't present in the log after the 
system wakes up.  That's why they didn't appear in the log you included 
in an earlier email.  The only way to observe them is to use a remote 
console, such as a network console.

In fact, that's pretty much the only way to debug problems that occur 
during a hibernation transition.

That's not true either.  The ohci_irq routine does indeed process 
interrupts even when rh_state is set to OHCI_RH_SUSPENDED.  How else 
could it handle a device's wakeup request?

During hibernation, the system is powered off.  Obviously the kernel is 
not capable of handling interrupts at this time.

Also, why would a device interrupt be reported at this time?  What 
causes the interrupt request?

No.  The freeze interface does not need to power-down the controller.  
All it needs to do is make sure that no communication between the 
computer and the attached USB devices takes place, and this is handled 
by ohci_bus_suspend.

Furthermore, it is a mistake for the freeze routine to change anything 
unless the thaw routine reverses the change.  Your patch leaves the thaw 
callback pointer set to NULL.

Something else must be happeneing, something you don't understand.
