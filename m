That doesn't look to be a RNDIS control packet.  I collected a bus
analyzer log as well w/ this snippet, and nothing was transmitted from
the host side during the data stage.  Subsequent SETUP transactions were
standard USB descriptors (GET string descriptors).

So back to the original issue, which was the SETUP timeout during pullup
disable, I went ahead and collected the ftrace w/ a change to just
remove the return statement:

ret = wait_for_completion_timeout(&dwc->ep0_in_setup,
				msecs_to_jiffies(DWC3_PULL_UP_TIMEOUT));
if (ret == 0) {
	dev_err(dwc->dev, "timed out waiting for SETUP phase\n");
	return -ETIMEDOUT;
}

This would allow the __dwc3_gadget_stop() to disable EP0/1, which would
call dwc3_gadget_stop_active_transfer() to send the end xfer command:

Does this look ok, Thinh?
