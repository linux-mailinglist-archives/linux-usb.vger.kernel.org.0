Hello Bryan, Thank you very much for your review comments.

Will be replying to your comments and will be posting new patchset soon 
as per review comments.

I have asked this query with Bjorn Also against his review comments, 
whether we need to persist with extcon or need to switch to usb role 
switch framework, as we are notifying not only to usb controller but 
also to pmic charger so in case we adopt usb role switch then how we 
will notify to pmic charger to enable charging battery ? Also as i 
mentioned there my dilema is it does not look very apt to model EUD hw 
IP as c type connector, so please let me know your views.

I am writing to EUD control port so that when EUD is enable, EUD hw IP 
can intercept VBUS and d+/d- signal and can reroute to PMIC or USB as 
per host application command in debug mode.

so for example in debug mode VBUS signal although asserted on connecting 
phone with host PC, but EUD based on debug application command can 
notify USB to detach(which otherwise would have detected and attached)

Will evaluate and take corrective action if needed.

I am not sure if EUD interface is true USB connector or should be 
modeled so, as EUD can trick usb controller about absence of VBUS/d+/d- 
signal. To illustrate, when in debug mode even if phone is connected 
with PC, EUD can notify USB controller to stop USB s/w stack, by 
notifying USB controller about usb detach event, even when d+\d- signals 
are valid. moreover in debug mode USB controller will always configure 
in device mode, so let me know if EUD qualifies to be modeled as child 
of controller node?

charger state is to be notified to charger driver to start charging 
battery so if i switch to usb role switch framework, how will i notify 
to pmic charger? so if i have to adopt usb role switch framework then 
also i will have to keep extcon framework, let me know your comment.

as i mentioned usb-role-switch will only cater need to notify to usb 
controller so please let me know your views.
