I would suggest trying it out and seeing if it will work properly.  CPU
speeds are faster now, so a larger buffer will probably be just fine,
but I think the original goal here was that the majority of the "real"
information was in the beginning of the urb (protocol stuff, not
data), so the end of the urb wasn't all that necessary to see if the
buffer was too big.  And, as you point out, 480 Mbit was the speeds
then, we didn't think that USB would ever be boosted to go this fast :)
