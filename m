OK.

OK. Let's take this example
- Port is dual-role port micro AB.
- microAB to type-A adapter is connected which pulls ID low. port transitions
to "host" role by the controller driver.
- proprietary protocol want to switch role to device role so writes "device" to
mode switch sysfs. port transitions to "device" role.

Now, how does controller driver know to fall back to HW based role switching?
