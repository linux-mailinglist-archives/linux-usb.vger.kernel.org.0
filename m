The author of commit 46ee4abb10a07bd8 put a link to his device. I have 
the same one (or a clone) and it works fine in serial mode without the patch.
I have a different model that works the same way. A jumper selects the mode.

I can't be sure that no one has ever built a board with that chip, selecting
the wrong mode. But the chip is about 10 years old now; someone would have noticed.

That's the only PID that works for I2C/SPI/GPIO. Right now the serial driver is 
claiming it. I don't know what else to say. If I can't revert that patch, my driver
can't be used without blacklisting the serial driver.

i2c, spi and gpio can all be used simultaneously. I have a working spi implementation,
but I'm still testing it. Basically if a user wants to use spi, then 3 specific gpios
will be reserved for MOSI/MISO/CLK (using gpiochip_request_own_desc), with possibly 
one or more used for the chip select. 
How a user books spi is up in the air right now. That might be done through a sysfs command.

Frank.
