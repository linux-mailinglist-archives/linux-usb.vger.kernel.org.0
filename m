No, not really.  The set_bit() call was added by me in a much earlier
commit (8808f00c7adf, merged in 2008).  Lan Tianyu merely added the
"if" test, so that set_bit() doesn't always get called.  Now with this
change, set_bit() never gets called.

While some code review by people who are familiar with this material 
wouldn't hurt, I don't think you need to worry about any additional 
testing.

Thank you.  I'll submit the patch soon.
