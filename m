I think it's fairly common for drivers to download firmware to their
devices.  I guess there's not really any need to download the firmware
until a driver wants to use the device, right?

So IIUC, the three-way dependency involves:

  1) brcm_pcie_probe(), which initialize the PCI host controller
  platform device, enumerates PCI devices, and makes them available
  for driver binding,

  2) the firmware mailbox initialization (maybe
  rpi_firmware_probe()?),

  3) quirk_usb_early_handoff(), which downloads firmware to the VL805
  PCI USB adapter via rpi_firmware_init_vl805(), which uses the
  firmware mailbox?

Is there some way to express a dependency between
"raspberrypi,bcm2835-firmware" (the platform device claimed by
rpi_firmware_probe() and "brcm,bcm2711-pcie"?  If we could ensure that
rpi_firmware_probe() runs before brcm_pcie_probe(), would that solve
part of this?
