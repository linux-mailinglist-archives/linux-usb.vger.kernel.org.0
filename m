Thanks for the report!

Greg, please revert commit 5b6164d3465f, it clearly is not an
improvement, at least at this point.

> But I don't think this commit is the actual problem...

Well, it may not be the root cause, but it is a change in behavior
that exposes the breakage and this is not the only problem introduced
by it.

Well, it cannot know beforehand that the consumer is going to be
registered as a child of the supplier.

Clearly, device_add() needs to check if there is a device link between
dev and dev->parent, but it is not so clear what to do if such a link
is present.

I would make it return an error in that case.

IMV the bug is in the code that attempts to create a device link
before registering the child and it clearly shows that creating device
links from unregistered consumers is not really a good idea in
general.

In principle, a device link creation flag to instruct
device_link_add() to fail if the consumer is not registered can be
added and it can be used by the code in question if that helps.
