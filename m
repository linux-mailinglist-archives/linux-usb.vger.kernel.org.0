It has some errors in my commit message, I describe the process of linux
restart is wrong. A PC is connected to our arm soc development board
through the usb cable, the adb program runs via usb connection. there is
a very important application in our linux system. when it goes wrong(halt
or kernel panic), we want to restart linux. my wrong description happened
here, when I manually kill this important application for testing, I
thought it was calling the reboot command to restart linux, which is wrong.
our real implementation is through watchdog, when the application no
longer sets the watchdog and the watchdog times out, but watchdog can't 
reset the whole soc. our soc has 3 cpu clusters, one cluster has a arm 
Cortex R5 cpu for boot and security. one cluster has 2 arm Cortex A55 for
linux system. the other cluster for android. when the Cortex R5 detect
the watchdog timeout and want to restart linux system, it will stop Cortex
A55 cpu to run, and load linux image to DDR memory from eMMC flash, then
set Cortex A55 cpu to run new linux system, but it was not reset usb
controller. so the usb controller's status is incorrect for boot new linux
system.

Under normal circumstances, run the reboot command and rmmod the
corresponding usb module, it will carry out the corresponding state
processing, all of which can work well.

Balbi, for this case, Currently, the way I can think of is to reset the
DCTL register every initial time. Could you help me and give me some
suggestions? thank you very much!
