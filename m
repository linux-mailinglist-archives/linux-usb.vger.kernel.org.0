How do you know if a port is "open" or not and keep track of them all?
Trying to manage that is a pain and a refcount shouldn't need locking if
you use the proper refcount_t type in a sane way.

Try to keep it simple please.

Why would submitting urbs in parallel not work?  Is the device somehow
broken and can't accept multiple requests at the same time?
