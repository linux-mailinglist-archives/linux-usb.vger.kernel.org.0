I think we need a better understanding of the underlying issue before
adding a quirk like this.

Is this a known issue with the uPD720201 controller firmware? or is it
an issue with ACPI table entries not supporting the proper D state in BIOS
on the tested platform, or something completely different?

Also, LPM usually refers to "Link Power Management" in the xHCI spec.
This is about the U1 and U2 link states for the connected USB device.

If we end up needing a new xhci quirk it will need a new name.

Thanks
