Please do so. But make sure you read this thread first if you haven't
already:

	https://lore.kernel.org/r/YJ0OCS/sh+1ifD/q@hovoldconsulting.com

I don't remember all the details, but judging from a quick look it seems
we're just waiting for someone to resend the revert with a proper
explanation.

It would be good if Jan-Niklas could chime in too and confirm if he's
able to use the device in UART mode instead.
