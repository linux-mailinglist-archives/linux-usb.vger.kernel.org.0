Since I'm describing the behavior on the gadget side,
it seemed to me that the explanation about the impossibility
of receiving it was more appropriate.

Poll the IN Endpoint, fixed

Yes, any keyboard should use SETUP/SET_REPORT if it wants maximum
compatibility. This mode has no problems with hosts. I suggest it
as optional only because for the last 9 years the default behavior
has been OUT Endpoint and in the place of those people who use it,
I would be upset if this was changed, since it could lead to strange
problems like lack of a queue and loss of events if f_hid is used
for data transmission, and not for emulating input devices.

DYNAMIC is indirectly provided by the no_out_endpoints flag.
I preferred to avoid duplicating the code here.

Yep, you're right

Yea, I also thought about it and made such a name precisely
based on consistency. The rest of the code contains the out_ep
variable, so it was logical to make the use_out_ep flag.
In addition, there are no long names like *_out_endpoint anywhere.
At the same time, abbreviations are not used in configfs
and I didn't want to make a flag there that the user should change
to 0 if he does not want to use out endpoint. I would prefer
to leave it as it is, because it does not use negation logic,
and it will be easy for you to grep something like out_ep\>

Thank you for the review! I will fix this and make a third version of the p=
atch.
