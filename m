This isn't the case, we have those sample drivers to make it easy to review=
 the
the code and illustrate in an isolated context how it works. But, there has
always been a "real" user behind that. In the case of the DMA work it was N=

Well, this is true for Nova and Tyr, but I disagree that this is the reason=
 we
were able to break the chicken and egg problem.

For instance, the initial lift around the driver core, PCI, I/O, etc.
infrastructure was done by me, a single person. This could have been happen=
ing
in the context of a very simple and small driver as well, rather than a big=
 GPU
driver with lots of companies and people involved.

Igor (Cc) is doing the initial lift for I2C and Michal (Cc) for PWM for
instance.

So, I see those things happen and I don't think that such initial lifting
necessarily needs big companies with dozens of engineers being involved.

If we know people who want to write drivers for a subsystem that doesn't ye=
t
have Rust infrastructure (such as USB), let's encourage them to get started=
 /
involved anyways and let's help them as they go.

But also please don't get me wrong, I understand and very much appreciate y=
ou
want to get the ball rolling, but let's not discourage people by making it
sounds as if it would be impossible for individuals.
