If your goal is to prevent some unwanted _drivers_ from operating -- 
or all but a few desired drivers, as the case may be -- why extend 
the "authorized" API to all _devices_?  Why not instead develop a 
separate API (but of similar form) for drivers?

Wouldn't that make more sense?  It corresponds a lot more directly 
with what you say you want to accomplish.

What would you do in the theoretical case where two separate drivers 
can manage the same device, but one of them is desired (or hardened) 
and the other isn't?
