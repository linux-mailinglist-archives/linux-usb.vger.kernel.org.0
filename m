Really?  I bet there are plenty of drivers whose interrupt-URB (or
whatever) completion handlers just log an error message and blindly
resubmit when they get an unexpected kind of error.

I recall hearing from someone (many years ago -- the technology has
certainly improved since then) about a device that would start getting
errors whenever a noisy fluorescent light near the computer was
switched on.  :-)  But yes, this sort of thing is very uncommon.

So do you recommend editing drivers to prevent them from resubmitting
URBs whenever they get an unrecognized error, such as -EPROTO, -EILSEQ,
or -ETIME?  Then the driver would most likely stop working when one 
of these errors happens.

Alternatively, the USB core could keep track of these three kinds of
bus errors for all endpoints and fail submissions when the error count
gets too high.  That would end up having the same effect -- drivers
would stop working -- but it might be a little more robust against
noise and it wouldn't require editing lots of drivers.
