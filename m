Giving credit in the commit log is nice, but this still doesn't say
anything about *what* you changed.

You didn't reply to my comments that what should be done here is to
disable auto-RTS when clearing TIOCM_RST and re-enable it when setting
the same bit. If you disagree with review feedback you need to say so
and not just resend a new version of your patch without an explanation.

Note that the above would also needlessly prevent DTR from being changed
whenever auto-RTS is enabled and return success instead of an error to
user space.

My suggestion for how to suppress the error message from dtr_rts()
suffers from the same problem so I've updated that patch and implemented
proper RTS handling in the driver now.

This takes care not only of the SET_MHS error messages, but also makes
sure that RTS can always be deasserted and some other related issues
with regards to modem control.
