In the gate case I don't see how the implicitness will ever be a
problem.

Ah maybe. I always confuse power domains and genpd.

Right. Ideally it would be in the core code somehow so that if there
isn't a set_performance_state function we go to the parent or some
special return value from the function says "call it on my parent". The
translation scheme could come later so we can translate the "random"
integer between parent-child domains. At the end of the day the device
driver wants to set a frequency or runtime pm get the device and let the
OPP table or power domain code figure out what the level is supposed to
be.

Hmm alright. I think there's a constraint but otherwise nobody really
wants to change both at the same time.

Got it. So in this case we could have the various display components
that are in the mdss gdsc domain set their frequency via OPP and then
have that translate to a level in CX or MMCX. How do we parent the power
domains outside of DT? I'm thinking that we'll need to do that if MMCX
is parented by CX or something like that and the drivers for those two
power domains are different. Is it basic string matching?
