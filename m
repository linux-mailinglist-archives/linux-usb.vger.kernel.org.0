There are indeed platforms on their way, but I'll see if I can still
influence what goes into the ACPI tables of those platforms.

I'm trying to get the way the USB Type-C connectors are described
in ACPI (including the alternate modes) documented somewhere. I think
I already mentioned that to you already. There is now a discussion
with our Windows folks how to move forward with that. In any case,
additional nodes like that "altmodes" node are really problematic in
Windows because of way they handle the nodes, and to be honest, I
don't see any way I could convince those guys to accept it.

But all that is really not your problem. I have now a feeling that the
way we will end up describing the alternate modes in ACPI will not be
compatible with DT :-(. So I guess we can just go ahead with this, and
then add support for ACPI later?

thanks,
