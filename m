I'm not proposing that we drop the port-psys. I'm sorry if I've been
unclear about that. The port-psy we can not drop because of several
reasons. For starters, we still can not assume that USB PD is always
supported.

What I'm trying to propose is that we take advantage of the
power-supply framework by building a "dynamic" hierarchy of power
supplies that supply each other in order to represent the actual
situation as closely as possible. For example, a port-psy that is
supplied by port-Fixed-sink-psy that is supplied by
port-partner-Fixed-source (that is supplied by port-partner-psy).
Something like that. The only "static" part in the hierarchy is the
port-psy, as everything else about it can change, even without
disconnection.

So the port-psy always either supplies another psy or is supplied by
another psy in this hierarchy, depending on the role of the port. But
most importantly, the properties of the port-psy itself are _newer_
adjustable - they are read-only. The psy that supplies the port-psy
can be adjustable, if it's for example PPS, but not the port-psy
itself.

The problem with having only a single psy per port (and possibly
partners) is that it does not work well enough when the capabilities
change, and the capabilities can really change at any moment, we don't
need to disconnect for that to happen - simply by plugging another
device to another port can change the power budget for your port and
change your capabilities. The biggest problem is when we loose the
ability to adjust the values if we for example loose the PPS that we
were using in the middle of operation. The single psy has to attempt
to handle the situation by adjusting something like the ranges of the
properties, because it can't change the actual property set itself.
That is hacky, and to be honest, a little bit risky, because it leaves
us at the mercy of programmers completely unnecessarily.

With my proposal, if the capabilities change, it only means we rebuild
the psy hierarchy, and that's it. Nothing else needs to be done in
kernel, and all changes are super visible and clear in user space.

thanks,
