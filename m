Do you mean that you'd need to register a separate gpio chip per port in
order to expose an interface for changing the MODEx_y pins for an
enabled UART? Or can you do that through the "global" gpio device?

I understood from your other mail that the gpio device would not be able
to control the pins of an enabled port. In either case, I think you need
to refuse a request for a pin that's already in use by the corresponding
port.

Also is there a way to determine the number of available pins by
detecting the chip/package type? I'm assuming not all 36 pins are always
accessible?

Then it's hopefully fine. Thanks for verifying.
