This part has a suspicious look.  For one thing, there's no comment
explaining the purpose of the smp_rmb().  For another, that barrier
doesn't seem to pair with any other memory barrier in the driver.

I get that you want to avoid self-deadlock here.  But there must be a
better way.  See below.

Alternative approach:

	/* unbind the USB devices to avoid dangling references to this device */
	mutex_lock(&hub->lock);
	while (!list_empty(&hub->udev_list)) {
		node = list_first_entry(&hub->udev_list, struct udev_node, list);
		udev = node->udev;

		/*
		 * Unbinding the driver will call onboard_hub_remove_usbdev(),
		 * which acquires hub->lock.  We must release the lock first.
		 */
		usb_get_device(udev);
		mutex_unlock(&hub->lock);
		device_release_driver(&udev->dev);
		usb_put_device(udev);
		mutex_lock(&hub->lock);
	}
	mutex_unlock(&hub->lock);

hub, not dev.
