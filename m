Attempts to request system suspend when USB is not suspended, would result in a DISCONNECT.

The catch here is, what to do if the USB device is not in bus suspend state but user wants to put the system in suspend state? Do we still disconnect?

You might also want to refer to the discussion in [1]

For example if we are in a scenario where there is a network session (over USB) open between Host and the device and usb bus is suspended due to data inactivity. Option2 would preserve the session whereas Option1 we would terminate this session when a system_suspend happens.
