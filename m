Hi Thinh,

It'll always happen if usb_ep_queue() fails with an error. Sorry for not
clarifying, but the "..." represents executing in a different context
:). Anything above the "..." is in the same context.

Sorry for missing that part of the question.  It is a no xfer resource
error on a start transfer command.  So far this happens on low system
memory test cases, so there may be some sequences that were missed,
which led to this particular command error.

Thanks
