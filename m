So you're suggesting that we invent a 3rd mechanism (in addition to the
already existing duplication between extcon and usb_role_switch) for
propagating role switching notifications through the kernel?

I was under the impression that usb_role_switch is the attempt to
replace extcon as the one solution. The problem in the dwc3 case is that
the same piece of hardware (i.e. _the_ USB controller) needs to
implement and wired up as two separate consumers of that message.

I recognize the complexity caused by the flexibility in DWC3 based
designs, but I would like to see whatever combination be seen as a
single entity to the rest of the system - rather than building the
notification plumbing between the two pieces using DeviceTree.
