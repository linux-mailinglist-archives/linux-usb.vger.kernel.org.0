The requirement to keep a stable userspace ABI does not consider the
fact that the kernel made up part of that ABI based on things it found
in e.g. DT.

The name of the UDC devices has been and is simply the
dev_name(dwc3-device) and this is directly based on the DT node.

So changing DT indirectly changed the user space ABI and anyone who is
using USB Gadget Configfs is directly affected by this.

Is there such a thing as "UDC alias"? Or are you suggesting that we
should add such feature?

I think it would be wonderful if we could identify the UDCs on our
boards as "USB1" and "USB2", or "the one and only USB-C connector". But
unless that will fall back to the existing naming it would break John's
_existing_ userspace.

We could define that this is the way, but again we didn't yesterday so
your proposal is not backwards compatible.

Yes, and that's exactly where we are heading with the ongoing DT
validation work. But "don't break your users" isn't excused because the
ABI is derived from some third party.

Those are good suggestions, but they require changes in userspace.

I think it's a gray area, at least I do want it to be a gray area,
because I don't want device names to be part of the ABI.


The problem is that someone decided to use the device name in the USB
gadget configfs interface and as such made it part of the ABI.
