Do you unmount the stick before disconnecting it?

Assuming the workqueue delay is caused by the USB subsystem, you may be 
able to get more information by turning on USB dynamic debugging:

	echo 'module usbcore =p' >/sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

and seeing what shows up in the dmesg log.

One long-running job should not normally be enough to delay an entire 
workqueues.  Workqueues are allowed to spawn multiple threads; they are 
supposed to resize themselves dynamically as required.
