While testing the xr_serial (as currently merged), I opted to apply
the patches on the top of vanilla Kernel 5.11 - as it sounds too risky
to use linux-next so early on a new development cycle :-)

There, I'm getting an OOPS:

After adding this hack:

It works fine:

I'm not sure if the bug is at xr_serial or if it is inside usb-serial.c.

Any ideas?
