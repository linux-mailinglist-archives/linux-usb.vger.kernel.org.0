There are much worse problems than this in the alauda driver.  For 
example, alauda_get_redu_data() does I/O from a data buffer on the 
stack; this is not allowed.  That's just the example I noticed; there 
may very well be others.

If you want to fix something, fix that.

If you're still worried about malicious hardware, the way to fix the 
problem is not to change this one location.  Instead, you should modify 
the driver so that us->iobuf is not stored in DMA memory.
