We do still call dwc3_gadget_giveback() which would release the lock
briefly, so if there was another thread waiting on dwc->lock, it would
be able to add additional items to that list.

We would also need to consider that some of the APIs being called in
these situations would also have the assumption that the dwc->lock is
held, ie dwc3_gadget_giveback()
