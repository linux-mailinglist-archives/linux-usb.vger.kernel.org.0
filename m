s/enable/disable/

Have you tried manually unbinding and rebinding the two drivers a few 
times to make sure they will still work?  I'm a little concerned about 
all the devm_* stuff in here; does that get released when the driver is 
unbound from the device or when the device is unregistered?  And if the 
latter, what happens if you have multiple sysfs attribute groups going 
at the same time?

Apart from those worries and the typo, this looks pretty good to me.
