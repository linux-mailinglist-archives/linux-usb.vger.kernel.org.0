I agree removing that check is not the right way to fix this problem. It
just so happens, the USB resets disappear when that check is removed. It
is more likely that check needs to be refined further to differentiate
between a hub that was unplugged (reason for the original commit) and a
hub that is seeing split transaction errors on full/low speed devices.

I am not sure if hardware is broken. I currently am using one of the
four hubs I have in a working configuration. The hub I was using before
motherboard replacement on my desktop stopped working with new
motherboard. Suspecting hardware defect on the motherboard, I bought a
PCI plug in USB 2.0 card but that showed the same failure. So I got two
more USB hubs just in case my existing hubs were broken. In all I tried
seven combinations of hardware and five of them failed the same way.
Every one of these hubs, keyboards, mouse and tablet works with no
problems on my laptop. All high speed and super speed devices (various
storage devices I have) work flawlessly on my desktop plugged into any
port or any hub. My desktop is a Ryzen 5 3600X in an MSI B450-A pro max
motherboard. Previous motherboard on my desktop was an ASRock Z77
Extreme motherboard with Intel core i7-3770. My laptop is an Intel
i5-7300U in a Lenovo thinkpad. Somehow hubs are getting set up
differently for split transactions full/low speed devices between two
machines.

Since I have a working configuration of hardware, my next steps are to
use my desktop with working configuration of hardware and then go deeper
into USB debugging to find out what is wrong with non-working
configurations.

Thanks,
Khalid
