Am I reading this correctly?  It looks like usb_ep_queue() returns a 
-EINVAL error, but then the completion callback gets invoked with a 
status of -ECONNRESET.

Indeed, this predates the creation of the Gadget API; the same design 
principle applies to the host-side API.  It's a very simple idea:

	If an URB or usb_request submission succeeds, it is guaranteed
	that the completion routine will be called when the transfer is
	finished, cancelled, aborted, or whatever (note that this may 
	happen before the submission call returns).

	If an URB or usb_request submission fails, it is guaranteed that
	the completion routine will not be called.

So if dwc3 behaves as described above (usb_ep_queue() fails _and_ the 
completion handler is called), this is a bug.
