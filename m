Probing/initialisation has never been the problem. The issue for the 
kexec case is that when the first kernel shuts down, there is currently 
nothing to quiesce the controller (since only driver->shutdown gets 
called, not driver->remove), and thus (presumably) external USB activity 
causes it to keep writing back over the memory where the 
descriptors/command ring used to be while the second kernel boots. The 
second kernel will eventually probe and reset it appropriately, but by 
that time the damage is already done.

Yanking on a hardware reset line when the first kernel shuts down is 
certainly one way to stop any memory accesses if such a control is 
available, but presumably there's a general software way to gracefully 
disable the controller's DMA functions until a subsequent probe can 
fully reset it again - I think that would be the preferable solution.
