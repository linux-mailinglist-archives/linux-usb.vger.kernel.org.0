Hello, 

Please accept my apologies if this request does not meet your personal ethics as it is not intended to cause you any embarrassment in what so ever form. I got your contact from internet directory and decided to contact you for this transaction that is based on trust and your outstanding, I have an interesting business proposal for you that will be of immense benefit to both of us, Although this may be hard for you to believe, but we stand to gain Huge Amount between us in a matter of weeks, Please grant me the benefit of doubt and hear me out.

With due respect My name is Mrs. Victoria Holton, a Banker here in America! Late Mr. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Chairman of the King Power, a thailand billionaire businessman and the founder owner and chairman of King Power Duty Free. He was also the owner of England Premier League football club Leicester City from 2010 until his death in a 27th October, 2018 helicopter accident made a fixed deposit with my bank in 2015 valued at $25,200,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars) the due date for this deposit contract was last 30th of September 2018. Sadly Vichai was among the death victims in 27th, Oct 2018 in England helicopter accident that killed all 5 people in the helicopter, He was in England for Leicester home game which after the football match where he met his untimely end, as his Account Officer. Vichai did not mention any Next of Kin/Heir when the account was opened.

I don't want my Bank Directors to take the funds for their personal use, That is why I am seeking your co-operation to present you as Beneficiary to the account, since you are a foreigner and my bank head quarters will release the account to you, There is no risk involved; this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect us from any breach of law, It is better that we claim the money than allowing the Bank Directors to take it, they are rich already. I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we share the funds in this ratio, 50/50%, equal sharing. Let me know your mind on this and please do treat this information highly confidential.
