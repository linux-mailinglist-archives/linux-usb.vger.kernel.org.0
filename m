So this was never done in irq either. Perhaps you can remove that bit
too.

You seem to have some problem with your mail setup. The patch fails to
apply, and both checkpatch and git warn about the patch being corrupt:

	warning: Patch sent with format=flowed; space at the end of lines might be lost.
	Applying: USB: serial: mos7720: defer state restore to a workqueue
	error: corrupt patch at line 12
	Patch failed at 0001 USB: serial: mos7720: defer state restore to a workqueue

Can you look into that and verify that you can send the patch to
yourself and apply it first?

Johan
