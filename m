When the interrupt thread is the one that is enqueuing also the
zero-requests (like the uvc_video gadget) is doing now, we won't be able
to do that.

Right. But for this we have to know if the last request that will be
enqueued will be followed by an actual data request. As the uvc_video
gadget is implemented now, we can not do this.

It is only checking if the prepared list is empty and then it is
enqueueing zero or data requests from the complete handler depending
=66rom the outcome. It does not know if on the next enqueue the prepared
list will have some requests ready.
