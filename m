I read in some Processor documentation that in case the host tries to
fetch data from the client and no active TRB (HWO=3D1) is available the
XferInProgress Interrupt will be produced, with the missed status set.
This is done because the hardware will produce zero length packets
on its own, to keep the stream running.

In the empty trb case, after the Hardware has send enough zero packets this
active transfer has to be stopped with endtransfer cmd. Because every next
update transfer on that active transfer will likely lead to further missed
transfers, as the newly updated trb will be handled to late anyway.

The odd thing here is, that I don't see the refered XferInProgress
Interrupts with the missed event, when the started_list is empty.

But this would be the only case to fall into this condition and handle it
properly. Like alredy assumed in the following code:

static void dwc3_gadget_endpoint_transfer_in_progress(struct dwc3_ep *dep,
              const struct dwc3_event_depevt *event)
{
=2E..

        if (event->status & DEPEVT_STATUS_MISSED_ISOC) {
                status =3D -EXDEV;

                if (list_empty(&dep->started_list))
                        stop =3D true;
        }

=2E..

        if (stop)
                dwc3_stop_active_transfer(dep, true, true);
=2E..
}

In fact I did sometimes see these XferInProgress Interrupts on empty trb qu=
eue
after I stoped the tansfer when the started_list was empty right after
ep_cleanup_completed_requests has moved all trbs out of the queue.

These Interrupts appeared right after the ENDTRANSFER cmd was send. (But I
could no verify this every time)

Anyways in that case these Interrupts are not useful anymore, as I already
implied the same stop, with ENDTRANSFER after we know that there are no oth=
er
trbs in the chain.

Michael
