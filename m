As I understand it, the "removable" property refers specifically to 
the device's upstream link, not to whether _any_ of the links leading 
from the device to the computer could be removed.

This is probably what Oliver meant when he complained about losing 
information.  With the knowledge of whether each individual link is 
removable, you can easily tell whether there's some way to remove a 
device from the system.  But if you only know whether the device is 
removable from the system overall, you generally can't tell whether 
the link to the device's parent is removable.
