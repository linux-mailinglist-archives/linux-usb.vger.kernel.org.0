I don't know what the results mean, but I _can_ tell you what's
happening.  Every so often (at intervals of about a second) the pen
drive completely stops communicating with the "bad" kernel for about
one second and then starts up again.

Here's a short example from the "bad" trace:

ffff9169f0d399c0 513072808 S Bo:6:008:2 -115 122880 = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
ffff9169f0d399c0 514262176 C Bo:6:008:2 0 122880 >

The second column is a timestamp (in microseconds).  This little
extract shows a 120-KB write starting at time 513.072 and ending at
514.262, more than a second later.  Normally such a write would
complete in about 0.06 s.

The cumulative effect of all these delays is to slow the transfer 
drastically.  The "good" kernel trace shows a few delays like this, but 
only one or two.

I have no idea how commit f664a3cc17b7, getting rid of the legacy IO 
path, could have caused these delays.  It seems more likely that the 
pen drive itself is the cause, perhaps because it is flushing buffers 
more often under the "bad" kernel.

I'd like you to try doing another pair of usbmon tests.  This time,
start collecting the usbmon trace _before_ you plug in the pen drive,
and stop the trace shortly after the pen drive has been mounted.  
Don't try to transfer any data.  Perhaps the two kernels are
initializing the pen drive with different settings and that accounts
for the different behaviors.
