Probably, yes.  And you proved that below....

The PS/2 controller was horrible, even for keyboard and mice.  Many
motherboards and devices were blown up by hot-plugging them.

There's a reason we all came up with USB back in the day, please don't
make us go back to that mess...

This is not a "quirk", it is part of how USB works.

Nice!

Go blame your bios vendor now :)

But realize just what is happening here, the hand-off of the USB
hardware from one "owner" to another is not a trivial operation.

Gotta love solutions that don't touch the kernel, thanks for following
up and letting us know.
