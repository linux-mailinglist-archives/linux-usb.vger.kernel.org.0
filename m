In your case, the dwc3 is also the USB host controller, no?

The ACPI guys tell me that in ACPI we should rely on the _PLD
(Physical Location of Device) when determining to which USB Type-C
connector any given USB port (or any other port - like DP) is
connected to. Basically, the connector ACPI device node and the USB
port ACPI device node share the same _PLD, and that's how we know they
are connected. I'm already using that to create a symlink "connector"
for every USB port here: drivers/usb/typec/port-mapper.c

I'm not actually sure how did the ACPI guys think this will work with
USB device controllers, but if your controller is also the USB host
controller, then you will have a separate device node for every
port the host is controlling, and each of those will have the _PLD.

Can you send acpidump so I can take a look what you actually have
under your dwc3 ACPI device node?

        % acpidump -o my_acpi.dump

We most likely do need to update the fwnode_usb_role_switch_get() api
so that it also considers the _PLD, but your ACPI tables maybe
already OK (big maybe).

Let's first check if we can we use _PLD for this.
