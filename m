Andrea, another thing you could try is to collect a usbmon trace under 
one of the "slow" kernels.  Follow the instructions in 
Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt.  I think you could kill the file-copy 
operation after just a couple of seconds; that should provide enough 
trace information to help see what causes the slowdown.

(If you want, do the same test with a "fast" kernel and then we'll 
compare the results.)
