Instead, please run the following trace, given insert may be
called from other paths, such as flush plug:

=09/usr/share/bcc/tools/stackcount -K t:block:block_rq_insert

If you are using python3, the following failure may be triggered:

=09"cannot use a bytes pattern on a string-like object"

Then apply the following fix on /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/bcc/__init=
__.py

diff --git a/src/python/bcc/__init__.py b/src/python/bcc/__init__.py
