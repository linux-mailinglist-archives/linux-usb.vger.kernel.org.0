Hi Greg,

Ah, should be a u32 bitmap, and that is enough as USB spec only allows
32 EPs (IN+OUT eps) total.  That hasn't changed since USB2, so I assume
that will stay the same moving forward.  I can fix that.

I didn't want the ep bookeeping here to be too complicated.  For
example, in the TXFIFO resize situation, just knowing the number of
endpoints used can help determine if we have enough internal controller
memory to allocate per endpoint. (at minimum 1 FIFO per EP)  If the USB
configuration is going to be requesting more endpoints than FIFO memory
it has (unlikely), then it will fail the config bind.  Otherwise, we'd
end up enumerating w/ the host w/ the interfaces that were starved of
FIFO memory to be broken/non-functional.  This was one of the concerns
that Felipe had in our initial discussions.

In addition, at the time of function driver binding, the amount of
information we have is minimal per endpoint, as most of it is populated
once the host places the device into the CONFIGURED state. (ie when the
device knows which configuration is being enabled, hence which EPs are
being used)
