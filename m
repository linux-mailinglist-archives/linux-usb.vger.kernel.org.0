You're right about that.  I hadn't noticed before; it makes little sense 
to have a quirk that defaults to true.

It's not easy to tell the full story from the kernel history; that 
module parameter predates the Git era.  I did learn that it was modified 
in 2.6.3-rc3 and goes back even farther: see

Shall we try changing the parameter's default value?  The USB subsystem 
is a lot more mature and reliable now than it was back in 2004.
