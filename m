It works because there is no control pointing at other card. My main 
problem is with controls which have card and pcm id of other card in it.

This works only in your design, where USB Offload is backed by card, 
what happens if it is backed by something else?

It should be able to tell which one is being offloaded by examining 
which USB card has Offload control set to true.

I would assume that USB cards that cannot perform Offload have no 
control at all, as it is unneeded. And ones that can do, have Offload 
control. And ones actively being Offloaded have it set to true, 
otherwise to false.

End user has no need to know where it is offloaded. I'm not HW person, 
but I would assume that it is even unlikely that someone will design HW, 
where it is possible to Offload one endpoint to two different places, as 
this complicates things a lot, but if it were possible, from design 
perspective it would make a lot more sense to set it in Offloaded USB 
card settings, instead of some seemingly unrelated controller card 
device. And that is assuming that all solutions use some other card 
device to perform Offload.

Then it is implementation detail of your device, and it should be 
implemented as controls in your device instead of as part of generic API.
