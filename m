Ok then. I'll replace of_get_child_by_name() here with
of_get_compatible_child() matching just against "snps,dwc3" in v7. Can you
confirm that noone ever had a Qcom-based hardware described with dts having
the "synopsys,dwc3" compatible used as the DWC USB3 sub-node here? That
string has been marked as deprecated recently because the vendor-prefix
was changed sometime ago, but the original driver still accept it.

Alternatively to be on a safe side we could match against both
compatibles here as Rob suggests. What do you think?
