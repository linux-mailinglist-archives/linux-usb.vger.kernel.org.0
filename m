Right, this bit is clear.

Ok, thanks for pointing to QUSB2. The same mechanism is apparently used
in phy-qcom-usb-hs-28nm.c as well (even if the dtsi currently does not
define the wakeup interrupts).

Furthermore, that implementation is broken and has never worked due to
another half-arsed, incomplete Qualcomm implementation. Specifically, no
one is changing the PHY mode based on the current speed before suspend
as commits like 

	3b3cd24ae61b ("phy: Add USB speed related PHY modes")

and

	891a96f65ac3 ("phy: qcom-qusb2: Add support for runtime PM")

depend on. Guess I should go revert that mess too...

Yes, but that doesn't really say much since you never enable the hs_phy
interrupt in the PHY on suspend.

Are you sure there's no support for hs_phy_irq also in the "femto" PHYs
and that it's just that there is currently no driver support for using
them?

And why is it defined if there is truly no use for it?

Also, if hs_phy_irq and dp/dm_phy_irq were mutually exclusive, why does
the following Qualcomm SoCs define all three?

              - qcom,ipq4019-dwc3
              - qcom,ipq6018-dwc3
              - qcom,ipq8064-dwc3
              - qcom,ipq8074-dwc3
              - qcom,msm8994-dwc3
              - qcom,qcs404-dwc3
              - qcom,sc7180-dwc3
	      - qcom,sc7280-dwc3
              - qcom,sdm670-dwc3
              - qcom,sdm845-dwc3
              - qcom,sdx55-dwc3
              - qcom,sdx65-dwc3
              - qcom,sm4250-dwc3
              - qcom,sm6125-dwc3
              - qcom,sm6350-dwc3
              - qcom,sm8150-dwc3
              - qcom,sm8250-dwc3
              - qcom,sm8350-dwc3
              - qcom,sm8450-dwc3
              - qcom,sm8550-dwc3

Some of those use QUSB2 PHYs and some use "femto" PHYs.

And this comes from Qualcomm through commits like:

	0b766e7fe5a2 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add USB related nodes")
	bb9efa59c665 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Add USB related nodes")

Ok, thanks for clarifying what you meant by "HW acceleration".

I've only skimmed the virtualisation bits in xHCI spec, but it seems
Linux as VMM would still be involved in assigning these interrupts to
VMs.

This may possibly be something that we can ignore for now, but perhaps
someone more familiar with the hardware, like Thinh, can chime in.

But the second interrupt is described in the ACPI tables, which means
that a simple driver update could (in theory) allow for it to be used.

You need to get into the same mindset when it comes to devicetree. Even
if Linux currently does not use an interrupt, like the pwr_event_irq,
you should still add it so that when/if someone implements support for
it, an older platform using the original dt may also take advantage of
it.

Sure, there are complications and we sometimes break DT backwards
compatibility, but this is the goal that you should strive for.
