The driver core handles this for us, for a default device attribute
group, nothing new here.

Almost no one uses that function, and I'm really not sure that it does
that check either (got lost in the maze yesterday, I'll look into it
later today.)

This api is to replace the examples in this series that do NOT use the
create_bundle() api, which has the exact same functionality of "we don't
know if the driver was bound or not" logic.

Probes should NEVER be in an init section for obvious reasons.  Please
don't do that today.
