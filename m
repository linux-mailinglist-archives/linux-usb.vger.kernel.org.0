But this would be a step backwards. You want to keep the kernel in
control of the mode selection, which is fine, but then you have these
special cases where you have to give some of the control to the user
space. So instead of taking complete control of the mode selection in
user space, you want to create this partial control method of
supporting your special cases while still leaving "most" of the
control to kernel.

I don't believe this will work in all cases. I'm fine with the
priority as a way to tell the kernel the preferred entry order, but if
the user space needs to take control of the actual mode selection, it
has to take full control of it instead of like this, partially. This
just looks incredibly fragile.

So I'm still not convinced that there is any use for this. Either the
user space takes over the mode selection completely with the active
attribute files, or just leaves the selection completely to the kernel.
