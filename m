There are other possible reasons.  For example, what is the setting 
stored in /sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/control (fill in the "..." 
with the appropriate name for your device)?

If the file contains "on" then runtime PM is forbidden and the device 
will always remain at full power.  If the file contains "auto" then the 
device will be subject to normal runtime-PM suspends and resumes.

More accurately, it is a USB device with one interface which is not 
bound to a driver.

Correct.  By default, all USB devices except hubs are forbidden to go 
into runtime suspend.  This setting can be changed by userspace (by 
writing to the sysfs file mentioned above).

There are programs, like powertop, which will automatically write
"auto" to the power/control sysfs file when a new device appears.  
Doing so calls pm_runtime_allow(), which decrements usage_count.

It is not necessary.  Check that sysfs file and see what it contains.  
In fact, you can check the contents of all the files in the device's 
sysfs power/ subdirectory.
