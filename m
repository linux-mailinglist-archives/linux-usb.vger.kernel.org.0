Whether or not to put a space after the ')' in a typecast is a matter 
of personal choice; CodingStyle doesn't say anything about it.  Quite 
often the space is present.  IIRC, that is how K&R does it.  But it 
doesn't really matter.

This is another lousy place to put the new value.  A much better
position would be immediately after "u8 level".

You should move into this patch the code added to xhci.c to assign
udev->devaddr.  Without it, this patch is incomplete: devaddr will not
contain the correct value for devices on a USB-3 bus.  And it doesn't
belong in the 2/2 patch -- that patch is all about making xhci-hcd call
usb_clear_tt_buffer().
