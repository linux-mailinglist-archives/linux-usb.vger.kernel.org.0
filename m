Was the USB flash drive being used as a swap device for holding the 
hibernation image?  That's not likely to work very well.  At least, I 
doubt that it has been tested very much.

This diagnostic was suggested by the runtime PM error that occurred 
when the system was trying to store the hibernation image.  That's 
probably when the hub driver's URB got restarted.
