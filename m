Ok, that's fine, but as you are multiplexing stuff, so reference counts
are going to get complex.  I'll defer to Johan, but this seems messy.

Yes it does.

sorry about that, I misunderstood Johan's review comments here.  I'll
defer to him.

Why can't the host just keep sending data?  Only "stall" if you don't
have an active urb to send?  Or just keep creating new urbs for every
send transaction and then destroying them when finished?  That way the
data gets queued up in the kernel (have a max able to be allocated so
you don't create a DoS accidentally), and you should be ok.  I think
some of the other drivers do this, or used to in the past.

Ah, and what happened with that version?  Did it not work?
