Similar situation with fast_role_swap in the fixed sink PDO. It is not really a
current but an index to a table embedded in the r31_v18's table 6-16.
Importantly the value 0 implies the sink does not support FRS. So again it
seems to be unit-less so the suffix "_current" in its sysfs name is
questionable. The spec does help much here formally naming it: the "Fast Role
Swap USB Type-CÂ® Current" field in section 6.4.1.3.1.6 . The show function
for the fast_role_swap_current is defined in typec/pd.c but I didn't see any
invocations.
