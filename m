I have done more testing on this. It seems that this deadlock possibility
reported by lockdep is not the cause, but just a symptom.

For now, my conclusion is that the problem lies in the MUSB gadget driver
itself. Interrupts (in peripheral mode) on Rx endpoints are handled by
musb_g_rx(), which pulls requests from EP request queue. If there is no
request queued, it just returns without clearing the RXPKTRDY flag in the
RXCSR register (but the interrupt flag in the glue layer register has been
already cleared by the glue layer IRQ handler). This makes the received
packet wait for the next interrupt. If the Rx FIFO is full, no more packets
are received and no more interrupts are generated. The EP stays locked up
forever (or until the RXPKTRDY flag is cleared manually :)).

From what I have learned, the request queue being empty just happens
sometimes and it is not en error.

This bug became exposed by the new behaviour of netif_rx(). When BHs are
enabled, hardirqs are enabled too (for a moment) which causes the Rx
interrupt to be handled before a request is enqueued. If there are enough
such unhandled packets, the EP gets locked up.

Now I see that it was a bad idea. I just found this using git bisect.

I think it is not needed now. After I have modified the interrupt handling
code to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if there is no request queued and the FIFO
is full, neither __local_bh_enable_ip() nor lockdep complain (tested on SMP
and UP, with and without PREEMPT, on AM3358 and A64).

It would probably by nicer to ensure that no MUSB interrupts are handled
when a MUSB request callback is invoked from musb_g_giveback() (e.g. by
disabling MUSB interrupts before releasing the lock and enabling them after
acquiring it), but that could cause some side effects if the callback
relied on MUSB interrupts being enabled. And since there are no warnings
and everything works... I guess it is time to submit another patch then and
to forget about this one.

Thank you for your time!
