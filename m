So you're essentially doing two things in one patch here; you now
sending a suspend request for all hubs except a for the ones in the
quirk list that are sent a port power disable.

This isn't really reflected in the commit summary which says "workaround
for special hubs" as you're also changing the default implementation.

Probably better handled in two patches, or at least this needs to be
reflected in the commit summary/message better.

But this patch is so broken that I just sent a revert. There also some
style issues that should be addressed if you send a new version.

Missing spaces after { and before }.

This is the main problem: hub_udev->dev.parent does not represent a USB
interface so you cannot use to_usb_interface() or you'd pass a random
pointer to usb_match_id().

If hub_udev is a root hub, then hub_udev->dev.parent does not even
represent a USB device (but, for example, the parent PCI device).

Multi-line comment style is

Ditto.

Just break if ehset_prepare_port_for_testing() fails, which make the
code much more readable and avoids indenting the current code further
and break the 80 column (soft) rule.
