Right, but depending on the application this may be ok (e.g. reset and
initialise on first open after boot, which may have triggered a reset
anyway).

If control over first open is needed, the sysfs interface provides that
out-of-band.

Forgot to mention that using open-flags would prevent using standard
utilities like cat, echo and terminal programs. So for that reason a
termios and/or sysfs interface is also preferred.
