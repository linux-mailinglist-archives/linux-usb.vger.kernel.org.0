(attempt to 'summarize' and move the discussion from v1 [1] to here)

gregkh> Why not limit this check to a device type like your changelog mentions?

mka> It is not an sc7180 specific issue. It can occur on any platform where the
mka> dwc3 core has supplies that aren't ready when the dwc3-qcom driver probes.
mka>
mka> It won't blow up right away since it requires 'wakeup-source' to be set for
mka> the dwc3 core, which currently is only the case for 'usb@a600000' of the
mka> sc7280 AFAIK (I set it for sc7180 in my tree for testing, which is when I
mka> found the issue this patch intends to address).

krishna> As Mathias pointed out, no issue was seen so far on present QC targets

krishna> SC7280. We ran into some issues like wakeup from system suspend in

krishna> that eventually led us to this bug. But, we tried to add debug prints

krishna> as well : "supplier 88e9000.phy-wrapper not ready" and deferring dwc3

krishna> Since this is seen on multiple platforms, can we go ahead without
