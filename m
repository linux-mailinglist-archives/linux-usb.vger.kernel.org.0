I'm not silly here. Look, those APIs are for userspace. And if userspace
application cannot use this new TCGETS2 API (for more reasons) then they
stick with the old one TIOCSSERIAL. And your inputs just say that it is
not a good idea to switch TCGETS2 as this API stay broken in some
drivers. Silly is the one who do not see (or do not want to see it;
because of own API perfectionism) the reasons why new "proposed API" is
still not (widely) used and applications stick with TCGETS + TIOCSSERIAL.

That is why I'm asking, it is time to starting deprecating TCGETS2 and
create for example TCGETS3? Only just few application use TCGETS2, so
deprecation of TCGETS2 can be done _now_ without pain as this API is not
widely used.
