We checked in an earlier thread before I figured out the timing detail
- these power resources are being turned off at this point.

_PS0 is called after _PS3 in the above case.

My feeling is that on this platform, we are not actually entering
D3cold at any point. Linux appears to be powering off the specified
ACPI power domains, but after turning them back on and executing _PS0
to move to D0initialized, the pmcsr still reporting D3 state seems
highly suspicious to me.

Also, I just experimented adding a pmscr register read to the end of
pci_set_power_state() , after pci_platform_power_transition() has been
called. If the power was truly cut and we're in D3cold then I would
expect this to fail. However the register read succeeds and returns
the same value 0x103.

During resume, Linux seems to have accurately detected this failure to
transition to D3cold in pci_update_current_state() by reading pmcsr
and setting dev->current_state to D3hot accordingly. We then deal with
what looks like a D3hot->D0 transition, which suffers the same failure
as seen when I force Linux to avoid D3cold and actually do a "real"
D0->D3hot->D0 cycle.

Presumably on a platform where D3cold actually works, after the device
has then been moved to D0uninitialized via ACPI _PS0 and _PR0,
pci_update_current_state() would then read pmcsr and update
dev->current_state to have value D0?

So in terms of the review comment questioning if the function name
quirk_d3_delay() and accompanying message "extending delay after
power-on from D3 to %d msec\n" is good (or whether it should say D3hot
or D3cold), maybe it should say D3hot. Plus a comment noting that
D3cold doesn't actually seem to be fully cold on this platform, so
we're actually dealing with a D3hot -> D0 transition?
