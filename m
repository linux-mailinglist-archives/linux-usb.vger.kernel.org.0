Thanks. After i saw this patch i figured it out to remove and blacklist 
ch341 module to get CH341A working as I2C/SPI converter with i2c-ch341 
and spi-ch341-usb drivers.

I can confirm, CH341A works as serial converter with ch341 driver when it 
is configured as UART and has PID 5523. It can't work as I2C/SPI converter 
when configured as I2C/SPI and has PID5512 unless ch341 module is removed 
and blacklisted.

I'd like to take a look at that keeyees device from original commit 
message to see if it has EEPROM chip. I can hypothesize that some 
manufacturer of a CH341-based programmer could use external configuration 
EEPROM and mixed-up PID value. I haven't experiment with configuring 
CH341A with EEPROM but suppose it's possible to burn any custom VID:PID 
there. I don't think ch341 driver has to handle any of such custom 
VID/PID, especially if it conflicts with an original VID/PID assigned by 
chip manufacturer. In case of some peculiar devices it's possible to bind 
custom VID:PID to the driver via sysfs.

But it's just my hypothetical assumption how ch341-based device with PID 
5512 could work as UART in that case.

I just checked if CH341 that i have can work as UART when configured as 
I2C/SPI (PID 5512). I doesn't work: no output signal on TX pin, no 
loopback echo when RX connected to self TX.
