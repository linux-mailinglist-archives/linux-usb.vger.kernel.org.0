I think it is best to keep the flags specific to the issue rather than a one flag for
all issues with a specific version. This way you can re-use the flag irrespective
of IP version.

But best case is that Cadence put a IP revision register in common area as you
have previously suggested so driver can automatically apply quirks to specific
versions.
