The hardware is supposed to give you the upper limit, and then software
is allowed to poll more often if it wants to and is able to do so.

In this case that decision depends partly on what is connected to the
hub but also on how that device in turn has been configured,
specifically, whether runtime PM has been enabled or not.

Someone who doesn't use the downstream device, or who prefers to never
suspend it, may not be willing to pay the price for polling the hub more
frequently, for example. 

So this ends up being very much a policy decision which should be left
for user space.

But if you can come up with a generic interface for this, it could be
useful in other setups as well (non-DT, hot-pluggable, etc).
