Well, on boards which may have either SoC it's already got to detect the 
difference and make at least a couple of other DT adjustments; a handful 
more lines to check for a specific node and flip its status wouldn't be 
too horrendous (although I suppose you'd also want to check whether the 
EHCI is enabled first, to guess at whether the port's even wired up at all).

Or alternatively, as I said, simply don't bother doing anything - boards 
that only use RK3288W can enable OHCI in their DTS, and other boards 
that have been not using it for however many years can continue not 
using it even if it might technically be available on newer production runs.

Robin.
