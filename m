Yes, but, again, you never enabled them in the PHY (cf. QUSB2) so it's
hardly surprising that they do not fire.

Still good to know that requesting them doesn't trigger spurious
interrupts either since these are apparently enabled on most Qualcomm
SoCs even though they are not used. We should fix that too.

Ok.

Is there some other (non-wakeup) functionality which may potentially use
this interrupt?

So then including the hs_phy_irq for most of these SoCs was a mistake
and we should drop it from the bindings?

What about the QUSB2 SoCs that also define DP/DM, are both useable
there?

And if so, is there any reason to prefer one mechanism over the other?

It seems Linux acting as VMM would need to be involved in configuring
such interrupts and passing them to the VM that eventually use them.

Yeah, I don't know how such things would best be handled.
