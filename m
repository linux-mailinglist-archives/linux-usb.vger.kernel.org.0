Thanks for the clarification.

Yes :)

Not all platform firmware (i.e. BIOS for x86) cut USB power during S3, as I describe in last reply.

Thanks for the clarification, I believe it's a case that should to be handled separately.

So we have three cases here. Assuming reset_resume isn't flagged by btusb:

1) Both USB power and BT firmware were lost during suspend.
USB core finds out power was lost, try to reset resume the device. Since btusb doesn't have reset_resume callback, USB core calls probe instead.

2) Both USB power and BT firmware were kept during suspend. This is my case.
Regular resume handles everything.

3) USB power was kept but BT firmware was lost. This is your case.
USB core finds out power was kept, use regular resume. However the BT firmware was lost, so resume fails.
For this case, maybe we can use btrtl_setup_realtek() in btusb_resume()? It won't re-upload firmware if firmware is retained, and will do proper initializing if firmware was lost.
