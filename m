[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 42 of them as possibly being bugs in the usb subsystem.  This category
mostly includes USB driver bugs, but it might include some core USB bugs too. 
I've listed these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first
the reports most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 42 bugs, 24 were seen in mainline in the last week.

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the usb subsystem, please let me know,
and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:
