Alan, I fully concur with your perspective. Specifically, I maintain that t=
he
device's runtime status should remain consistent before and after
system deep sleep.
To keep parent runtime-active during child wake, use device_link_add
create a link between them. Then dwc3_resume's pm_runtime_set_active
forces parent wake-up first.
However, for the dwc3 driver, both Rafael 's two solutions and
My aforementioned solution introduces new issues. When USB performs
deep sleep wake-up, the USB PHYS fails to initialize properly because
deep sleep wake-up executes runtime resume first, leaving the PHYS
initialized with per-sleep configurations. This ignores Type-C interface
requirements to reconfigure PHYS based on plug orientation.

Following your suggestion, I conducted verification. If the child device
is in a runtime suspended state, the suspend and resume callback should
not be invoked. The proposed solution is as follows:

It is preferable for the PM core to maintain the runtime status
between parent and child devices,
where feasible. Could you advise on the most effective approach to
settle this issue?
