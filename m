If my memory serves, I put it in over 20 years ago, about the same time
as the sg v2 interface (struct sg_io_hdr) was implemented. And when I
put it in it was a (signed) int and this is why:

struct ccb_accept_targ3 {
     .....
     CAM_I32 cam_resid;    /* Transfer residual length: 2's comp */
     .....
};

[from cam3r03.pdf]

So it coped with both underflow and the less likely case of overflow.

Notice in:
    struct sg_io_hdr {
       .....
       int resid;  /* [o] dxfer_len - actual_transferred */
       ...
};

At the time the SCSI mid-level and the block layer didn't bother about
resid, only some LLDs which is where the sg driver picked it up from.

So some ignoramus changed it to unsigned since then, probably before
git strangled the kernel source tree.

Linux's internal representation is wrong and should be fixed to match
its exposed interface (struct sg_io_hdr) which predates the breakage.
