Hei hei,

following this discussion with some kind of curiosity, because I own
such a device and depent on it, but my firmware version does not seem
to be affected.  Remarks below.

As pointed out in the GitHub ticket already:  Firmware update from a
users point of view is difficult to impossible.  There's no easy "take
the latest firmware" and update and you're done.  It is not clear
which tools are necessary, and even worse there are only certain
combinations of upgrade paths.  For example upgrading to x.z is only
possible from x.x but not from x.y, if I understood it correctly.  And
you don't know if you will brick the device or not.  And I'm speaking
as an embedded developer.  The ordinary home user is probably not even
going to try it.

Is it possible to hook in with some kind of quirk if this device ID is
seen on the bus (and wait longer just for this device), or can you
only access that after successful init?
