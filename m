Yes, rpi_firmware_init_vl805(), I'll update the description.

Noted, I'll be more explicit on the next version of the series. More in dep=

explanation below.

Sorry it wasn't clear enough, I'll redo this comment. Also note that the PC=
Ie
bus and the XHCI chip are hardwired, so that's the only device that'll ever=
 be
available on the bus.

VIA805's XHCI firmware has to be loaded trough RPi's firmware mailbox in
between the PCIe bus probe and the subsequent USB probe. Note that a PCI re=
set
clears the firmware. The only mechanism available in between the two operat=
ions
are PCI Fixups. These are limited in their own way, as I can't return
-EPROBE_DEFER if the firmware interface isn't available yet. Hence the need=
 for
an explicit dependency between pcie-brcmstb and raspberrypi's firmware mail=
box
device.

Your concern here showcases this series' limitations. From a high level
perspective it's not clear to me who should be responsible for downloading =
the
firmware. And I get the feeling I'm abusing PCI fixups. I haven't found any
smart way to deal with this three way dependency of platform/non-platform
devices. I even looked into adding -EPROBE_DEFER support to fixups, but I f=
ear
that would entail moving them into the core device definition.

Regards,
Nicolas
