It depends on the details of the hardware, but yes, it is possible in
general for an interrupt handler to run after you have turned off the
device's interrupt-request line.  For example:

	CPU A				CPU B
	---------------------------	----------------------
	Gets an IRQ from the device
	Calls handler routine		spin_lock_irq
	  spin_lock_irq			Turns off the IRQ line
	  ...spins...			spin_unlock_irq
	  Rest of handler runs
	  spin_unlock_irq

That's why we have synchronize_irq().  The usual pattern is something
like this:

	spin_lock_irq(&priv->lock);
	priv->disconnected = true;
	my_disable_irq(priv);
	spin_unlock_irq(&priv->lock);
	synchronize_irq(priv->irq);

And of course this has to be done in a context that can sleep.

Does this answer your question?
