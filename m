It's not good example. The configfs entries (file names) are
user-visible however the USB gadget exposes specific value for specific
one device. It encodes device specific DT node name and HW address and
gives it to user-space. It is valid only on this one HW, all other
devices will have different values.

User-space has hard-coded this value (DT node name and hardware
address). This value was never part of configfs ABI, maybe except of its
format "[a-z]+\.[0-9a-f]+". Format is not broken. Just the value changes
for a specific device/hardware.

It's like you depend that lsusb will always report:
  Bus 003 Device 008: ID 046d:c52b Logitech, Inc. Unifying Receiver
and then probing order changed and this Logitech ends as Device 009.
Then AOSP guys come, wait, we hard-coded that Logitech on our device
will be always Device 008, not 009. Please revert it, we depend on
specific value of Device number. It must be always 009...

For the record - the change discussed here it's nothing like USB VID/PID. :)

Best regards,
Krzysztof
