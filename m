Thanks for clarifying.

I'd suggest that you just send two separate series, one with binding and
driver updates, which will eventually be merged by Greg, and one with
the devicetree changes, which goes through Bjorn's tree.

It's good if you could add a link to the binding series in the cover
letter of the devicetree changes as they are of course going to be quite
closely related and need to be reviewed in parallel.
