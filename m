No, the PHYs use different - lower voltage - supplies to operate. VBUS
is coming from a 5V supply straight to the connector and plug-detect
logic (which is passive in this design).

The examples given in the DT bindings describes the connector as a child
of a PMIC, with of_graph somehow tying it to the various inputs. But in
these examples vbus is handled by implicitly inside the MFD, where
extcon is informed about the plug event they toggle vbus as well.

In our case we have a extcon-usb-gpio to detect mode, which per Jorge's
proposal will trickle down to the PHY and become a regulator calls on
either some external regulator or more typically one of the chargers in
the system.


So if we come up with a struct device for the connector and some API for
toggling the vbus we're going to have to fairly abstract entities
representing pretty much the same thing - and in a design with a mux we
would have a different setup.
