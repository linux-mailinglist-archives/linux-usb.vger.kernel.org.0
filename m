(I haven't checked the details recently, so I'm not certain about 
this.)  In some -- perhaps all -- cases, we don't suspend the ports at 
all during system suspend.  We just rely on the USB devices 
automatically going into suspend when the root hub stops sending 
packets.

Okay, I see.  It seems like the driver will need some significant 
changes to handle runtime power management properly.

One thing you might consider changing: The name of the 
ohci_at91_port_suspend routine is misleading.  It doesn't really 
handle suspending the port; instead it handles the clocks that drive 
the entire OHCI controller.  Right?
