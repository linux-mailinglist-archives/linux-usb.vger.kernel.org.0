Yes, as I said, there's already 2 ways to do this. The second is
defining the USB bus under the USB host. I'm sure there's some
examples in the tree.

How is a USB hub connected to the 'platform bus'? There's no such
thing as 'platform bus' in DT.

Like other probe-able buses, we describe the devices in DT when they
have extra resources/config which are not probe-able.

It shouldn't be a platform device, but associating a device_node with
the usb device. I think at least that is there in the kernel.

Though if you need setup to happen before the device is probe-able
which appears to be the case here, then that is a common problem which
isn't really a solved issue. There's the mmc-pwrseq stuff, but I don't
want to see a repeat of that. There was an #armlinux irc discussion I
had with Florian on this just 2 days ago[1]. If the only thing you
have to configure is 'reset-gpios', then you probably can do that
generically scanning all the child USB DT devices and deassert reset.
But as soon as you have device specific things and need specific
ordering and timing, then you'll need device specific code to handle
it.

That has generally worked because little is shared between BT and WiFi
and what is shared is refcounted (clks for example). That could work
here, we just have to be careful.
