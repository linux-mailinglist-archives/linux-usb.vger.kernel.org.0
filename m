I don't know what you mean when you say "backed by".  usb3 and usb4 are 
the two root hubs of the xHCI host controller.  usb3-1 is an internal 
hub (presumably built into the monitor) attached to the usb3 root hub.

Why are the usb3 port connectors getting bound at this point rather than 
when usb3 was registered?

I'm actually puzzled by this line.  Apparently the mysterious Realtek 
BillBoard Device claims that it is capable of connecting at high speed, 
but even though it was attached to a high-speed hub it only connected at 
full speed.  Things like this have shown up in other users' reports but 
I never bothered to point out the inconsistencies to anyone.

Either the device is lying about its capabilities or else it is 
malfunctioning.  Either way, I guess there isn't anything the kernel can 
do about it.

Yes.  I would guess this happens because of the way the port connectors 
were registered in the first place (see my question above).

That last sentence is totally wrong.  usb3 and usb4 are closely 
connected, since they represent logical components of the same xHCI 
controller, and they will always be unregistered in the same order.  
usb3 is the USB-2 root hub (the one connected to the physical wires 
carrying the USB-2 low/full/high-speed signals), and usb4 is the USB-3 
root hub (the one connected to the physical wires carrying the USB-3 
SuperSpeed and SuperSpeedPlus signals).

> Hope things make a little bit more sense now.

This still leaves the puzzle about why the typec things are handled this 
way.  In particular, if connector_unbind undoes the binding of the typec 
ports that happened when usb4 was registered, then what action is 
typec_unregister_partner supposed to undo, and when was it supposed to 
happen?  As a general rule, disconnection and unregistration actions 
take place in the reverse order of the corresponding connection and 
registration actions.

Questions like this are best directed at the maintainers of the 
USB-4/Thunderbolt and typec subsystems.
