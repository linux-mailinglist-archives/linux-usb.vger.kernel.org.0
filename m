It was something a bit more then around 2ms AFAIR. Since with one frame
enqueued we only trigger the interrupt every 16 requests (16*125us =3D 2ms)

So with at least 2ms latency we did hit the sweet spot in several cases.

The details are not that important. Sure the is a bug, that needed to be
solved. But all I wanted is to improve the overal dwc3 driver.

Yes. But as mentioned above, this was not the case. Speaking of, there
is currently a bug in the uvc_video driver, that is not taking into
acount that actually every zero-length request should without exception
need to trigger an interrupt. Currently we also only scatter them over
the 16ms period, like with the actual payload. But since we feed the
video stream with the interrupts, we loose 2ms of potential ep_queue
calls with actual payload in the worst case.

My patch is already in the stack and will be send today.

I totally understand this. And as we already found out more and more
about the underlying complexity of the dwc3 driver I see more and more
clearer how we have to handle the corner cases. I just started this
conversation with Avichal and you in the other thread.

https://lore.kernel.org/all/17192e0f-7f18-49ae-96fc-71054d46f74a@google.com/

I think there is some work to come. As to be sure that everybody is on
the same page I will prepare a roadmap on how to proceed and what to
discuss. There are many cases interfering with each other which make the
solution pretty complex.
