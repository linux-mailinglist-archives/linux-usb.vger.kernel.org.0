Since every one of the command handler functions uses this convention, 
it would be wasteful to have separate documentation of the return value 
for each function.  A single documentation comment that covers all the 
command handlers would be acceptable.

If you want, okay.  That should go in a separate patch from the 
documentation patch.

Also, since the return values are different for each command handler, I 
suggest that the macro definitions be placed along with the handler 
functions and not in a separate header file.  Having a separate file for 
these macros would not make any sense, because the values do not need to 
be shared across multiple functions or source files.

That incoming implementation uses the refactored command handling but 
doesn't depend on the refactoring.  It could just as easily use the 
existing command handling.

Unless you can provide a convincing reason for this change, it doesn't 
seem like an improvement to me.  It's no easier to read or understand, 
and it doesn't improve execution speed on a critical pathway.  It just 
seems like pointless code churn.
