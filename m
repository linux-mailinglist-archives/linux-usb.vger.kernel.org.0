Apologies for the delayed response to your requests.

The result of the above test:

 1. With both the PL2303 and CH341 in 8N1, "q" is received correctly by
    both ends.

 2. With the CH341 configured for 7N1 in minicom and the PL2303 left in
    8N1, a "q" sent by the CH341 system is received as "q" by the PL2303.

Thus your suspicion seems to be correct: the LCR changes are not taking
effect on the CH341.

A you expected, I can confirm that with the most recent patch in place as
sent:

 1. There are no delays sending or receiving characters on the CH341.

 2. There is no loss of the first character sent or received by the CH341.

 3. With both the PL2303 and CH341 in 8N1, "q" is received correctly by
    both ends.

 4. With the CH341 configured for 7N1 in minicom and the PL2303 left in
    8N1, a "q" sent by the CH341 system is received as "q" by the PL2303.

That is, it seems to work (notwithstanding the LCR issue).

I commented out the "priv->version < 0x30" conditional to re-enable the LCR
update and repeated the above test.  The result was the same: with the
PL2303 in 8N1 and the CH341 supposedly in 7N1, both ends received a "q" as
"q".

It seems there are still some mysteries left to solve surrounding the
earlier chips.  At least they seem to work in 8N1 through, which is what
most things would be using these days.
