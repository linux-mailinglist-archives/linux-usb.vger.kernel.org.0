Hi Felipe,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I went into the office to capture a USB
trace to better show you the difference with and without the TXFIFO
resize changes.  Let me address your comments below first before showing
the traces.

Unfortunately, based on Ferry's testing, it looks like the Intel HW
platform itself doesn't have a SS capable port.  Although, we did get
some good information from it, as we found that math is different
between controller revisions.

Let's go over the trace.  If you are still convinced this would help
with the particular scenario we're looking at, then I can run this test
with the above.

The iperf server (receiver) would be running on the PC, and the iperf
client would be running on our device (transmitter).

Sorry for confusing you.  So you are right about NumP being applicable
to the receiver path, and the PC USB host controller also will have its
own RXFIFO, which for the IN direction correlates to the NumP value
being sent by the host within the ACK.  The point I was trying to make
is that, the bus utilization is not hampered by the host running out of
RXFIFO (getting ACKs w/ NumP=0), but with the device always pre-maturely
ending the burst.

So I went ahead and captured USB Lecroy log with the following conditions:
- bMaxBurst value = 6
- TXFIFOSZ = 6 max packets (with resize) / TXFIFOSZ = 1 max packet (w/o)
- Test case = USB tethering w/ IPERF loopback (between PC and device)
- USB request size = 32kB
- Speed = USB3.1 gen 1

Trace Hierarchy:
Transfer
   --> Transaction
      --> Packet

1 transfer has multiple transactions, and 1 transaction has multiple
packets.  This is just how Lecroy does the packet groupings to help make
the traces more readable.  For now, we can focus on the "Packet" entries.

Observations:
- Within a transfer, there are no data packets w/ the EoB set to yes.
- Host never runs out of RXFIFO (NumP never reaches 0)
- Packets within a transaction is never interrupted with a NRDY.
(followed by an ERDY from the device to continue the transaction)

Observations:
- Since the current setting has TXFIFO size to only have 1 max packet,
the device sets the EoB to yes during the data packet.
- Within a transfer, there are multiple "transactions" as Lecroy groups
transactions whenever there is a NRDY --> ERDY transition.
- Frequent NRDY --> ERDY transitions coming from the device


I hope this clears up what the TXFIFO resize is actually helping with.
It keeps the burst continuously going w/o having to do a NRDY-->ERDY
handshake. (which is unnecessary overhead)  Even though we allocate more
USB requests from the SW, the SW has no control over how the request is
sent over the link.

Thanks
