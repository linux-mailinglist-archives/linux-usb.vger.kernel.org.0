The problem at hand is that the driver _needs_ a bunch of work.
Role-switching only works sometimes, extcon is (for older platforms)
duplicated in both glue and core - with the hope that each part does its
thing in a suitable fashion, the layering violations can trigger
NULL-pointer dereferences or use-after-free, PM runtime is marked
forbidden...

We've looked at these problems for a few years now, without coming up
with any solution to address these issues within the current design.

Following this refactor, we will be able to work on these improvements.
For this to happen, I intend to transition all the
arch/*/boot/dts/qcom/* platforms to the new binding as soon as possible.


Looking ahead, when we hit the point of deprecating the dwc3-qcom-legacy
driver:

The upstream-based product we have today do ship Devicetree in
combination with the kernel, so they would upgrade both together and get
the new driver.

The other group would be kernel developers, enthusiasts, specific users
who for some reason is upgrading their kernel but not their Devicetree.
These users will want the new features and stability we're bringing.

The new and old drivers are mostly identical at this point, and expected
to diverge from here.

The one thing I have identified to differ is that the "legacy" driver
supports 2 extcon handles in the glue, but this is not considered
acceptable by the binding so I haven't found anyone actually exercising
this code path - then again extcon and usb_role_switch is one of the
things this enables us to clean up.


That said, while this model seems suitable for Qualcomm, due to the
current state of things, I don't know if the same is true for Frank Li,
perhaps NXP has a broader user base and need the migration logic.

We're changing the Devicetree binding, which gives us two problems:
1) Devicetree source code and DWC3 driver code are merged through
different trees.

2) The compiled Devicetree (.dtb) and kernel image are in some cases
separate software deliverables.

So we absolutely need some migration mechanism to not just break USB for
everyone for the coming 1-2 releases - at least.

That said, the "2 LTS" is completely arbitrary. If you prefer to limit
that, we can certainly have that discussion! E.g. I wouldn't argue
against setting the flag-date by the end of this year.

We absolutely need a transition period, per above reasons. The length of
it is an open question.

Absolutely.

It certainly happens, but maintaining backwards compatibility is
something we're striving for. As the Devicetree bindings mature, the
easier this is though.

One example where this is a problem will be clear here, that users
attempting to boot today's kernel with tomorrows Devicetree blobs will
not get USB - because today's kernel doesn't know how to make of the
information in that description.

This is true for any hardware or firmware interface though, so there's
only so much one can do about that (and whatever that is, we're trying
to do - for the sake of user friendliness).
