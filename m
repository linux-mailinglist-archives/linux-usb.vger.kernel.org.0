sorry forgot to reply to the question about the buffer sizes.
The reason they are different sizes (in theory) is because
I get the size for each buffer from  usb_endpoint_maxp.
I do not know whether or not these are the same. If you have
any experience with these functions and know they are always
the same I am willing to make them the same size.
