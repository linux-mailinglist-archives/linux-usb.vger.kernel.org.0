it's a general DWC3 thing. The databook claims that a soft reset is
necessary, but it turns out it isn't :-)

That's good :-)

Right, initialize it in gadget mode, then take a register dump (I think
our regdump facility in dwc3's debugfs is enough). Then flip to host
mode and take the same register dump. Now diff them. You'll see that
some registers get overwritten. The reason for that is that physically
some host and peripheral registers map to the same block of memory in
the IP. In other words, the address decoder in the Register File decodes
some addresses to the same physical block of memory. This was done, I
believe, to save die area by reducing gate count.

I think the soft reset can have unexpected side effects here.
