The uvc_video gadget is queueing requests with ep_queue whenever they
are prepared. However for uvc we may not send EOF to the host until
we know that the frame was transmitted correct or wrong.

To ensure this the gadget is waiting for the last request to be
completed from dwc3. Until this request was not received, the current
workflow is to enqueue zero-length requests into the dwc3 hw. With that,
the final EOF request for the frame will be transmitted after the
zero-length requests have passed the hw. (They have no data, but they
still take one frameinterval durtion). This sparsed frame with
zero-requests inbetween will interfere with the precalculation for
request data we fill every request with based on the expected frame
duration.

I know this seems very interlocked. It is very complex indeed. Tell
me if you still have questions and I will come up with some more
details to the current uvc_video driver.

I think we have to discuss what is ment by resynchronization here. If
the trb ring buffer did run dry and the software is aware of this
(elemnt in the started and prepared list) then the interrupt handler
already is calling End Stream Command.

When the stream is stopped, what implications does this have on the bus?

When the Endpoint is enabled, will the hardware then send zero-length
requests on its own?

With the next ep_queue we start another stream and when we keep up with
this stream there is no underruns, right?

I picture this scenario in my mind:

thread 1: uvc->queue_buf is called:
   - we encode the frame buffer data into all available requests
     and put them into the per uvc_buffer perpared list
     (as we precalculated the amount of requests properly to the expected
      frame duration and buffer size there will be enough requests
      available)
   - wake up the pump thread

thread 2: pump_worker is triggered
   - take all requests from the prepared available buffer and enqueue them
     into the hardware
     (The pump worker is running with while(1) while it finds requests in
      the per buffer prepared list) and therefor will have a high chance
      to finish the pumping for one complete frame.
   - check for any errors reported from the complete handlers
     - on error
       - stop enqueing new requests from current frame
       - wait for the last request from errornous frame has returned
   - only start pumping new requests from the next buffer when the last
     request from the active frame has finished
   - In the beginning of the next frame send one extra request with
     EOF/ERR tag so the host knows that the last one was ok or not.

thread 3: complete handler (interrupt)
   - give back the requests into the empty_list
   - report EXDEV and errors
   - wake up the pump thread

With this method we will continously drain the hw trb stream of the dwc3
controller per frame and therefor will not shoot into one window where
the current stream could be missed. With the data spreading over the
many requests we also avoid the missed requests when the DMA was to
slow.
