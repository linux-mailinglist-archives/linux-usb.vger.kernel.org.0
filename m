Agreed. This is a good point. This reminds me why I never exposed the
product type VDOs in the first place.

Thanks for the heads up. For the record, I don't think you are the
only troublemaker :-). Some of the parts in the USB PD specification
and many parts in the USB Type-C specification have been a bit of a
moving target (though, I was hoping that things would have settled
down by now).

This is btw. the reason why I wanted to use interpreted kernel
specific attribute files for example with the roles instead of trying
to expose things like the specs says. I never accepted terms like UFP,
DFP, DRP or DRD, and I'm really clad I didn't - the meaning of those
has changed over the time in the USB Type-C specifications.

Because of the constantly changing specifications, the goal remains
the same. We pick only the details that we need, and that we are
pretty certain will not change, and expose those in our own format
(which ideally is human readable as well as machine readable) instead
of exposing all the data that those details are part of in the raw
format that follows the specification of today.

But I guess we can't pick any more specific details out of the
response to the Discover Identity. We are going to have to dump the
whole thing to the user as it is.


thanks,
