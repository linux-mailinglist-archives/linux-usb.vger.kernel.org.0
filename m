Maybe it's difficult to support both HW based role switch and SW based
role switch by sysfs at the same if the HW's FSM rely on, such as, the
state of Vbus pin or ID pin. Likes the upper example, when user writes
"device" to mode switch sysfs, the driver should skip the HW state of ID
pin, due to it's state is Low, or force it as High.

Another option way is that introduces a property in DTS to indicate the
way the driver want to use (HW based or SW based, usb_role_switch
doesn't provide this information for the controller driver), but is not
flexible enough.
