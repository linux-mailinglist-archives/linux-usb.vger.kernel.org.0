Only UsbOperational state supports sending start-of-frame packets, but 
in fact, in S3/S4 press test procedure,

usb in non-UsbOperational state that send start-of-frame packets but hc 
driver doesn't deal with this frame. and hc will

allways lauched the SOF for finishing the frame, the cpu will hand this 
sof interrupt and doesn't deal with time interrupt

that will cause rcu call trace then system doesn't suspend to memory/disk.

Hi Alan Stern,

     even though ed_rm_list is non-NULL, if hc in non-UsbOperation state 
set SoF status in usbsts register that is illegal,

at this time hcd doesn't need care URB whether finished,  because hc had 
into a wrong state. even thoug it doesn't has this patch,

URB was not be able to finish when hc in above worng state. except 
software can intervence this wrong state. but the SoF bit of usbsts

register was set by HC, and this action will happen always !!! software 
clear SoF state I think it isn't make sense. software only disable SoF

interrupt to fix HC wrong state.

       In additon, when kernel include my patch, that it does't happen 
about what you descriped that driver will not be able to finish 
unlinging URBs.

Because above issue happen in S3/S4(Suspend to disk/Suspend to mem) test 
procedure, if ed_rm_lis is no-NULL but my patch disable SoF interrupt.

then when S3/S4 recovery to cpu idle state that usb resume will be 
called, reume function has following logic, URB will continue to be 
processed.

       static int ohci_rh_resume (struct ohci_hcd *ohci)

      {

         ...

         242         if (ohci->ed_rm_list)
         243                 ohci_writel (ohci, OHCI_INTR_SF, 
&ohci->regs->intrenable);

        ...

       }

BRS,

Yinbo Zhu.
