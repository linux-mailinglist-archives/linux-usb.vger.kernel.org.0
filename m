Hi Thinh,

This was rebased on Greg's usb-linus branch, which has commit
f09ddcfcb8c5 ("usb: dwc3: gadget: Prevent EP queuing while stopping
transfers") merged.

commit f09ddcfcb8c5  moved the dwc->connected = true to after we have
finished stop active transfers.  However, this change will also ensure
that the connected flag is set to false to ensure that when we call stop
active transfers, nothing can prepare TRBs.  (previous commit only
addresses the case where we get the reset interrupt when coming from a
disconnected state)

Thanks
Wesley Cheng
