fingerprint readers are handled through a privileged daemon for the
past 14 years:
https://fprint.freedesktop.org/

Looking through libusb_open() users on the Debian repo[1], I could find
those types of devices that could make use of sandboxing:
- all manners of single-board computers and programmable chips and
devices (avrdude, STLink, sunxi bootloader, flashrom, etc.)
- 3D printers
- scanners
- LCD "displays"
- user-space webcam and still cameras
- game controllers
- video/audio capture devices
- sensors
- software-defined radios
- DJ/music equipment
- protocol analysers

There's also Rio500 support which I'm particularly attached to, and
many many more device types, including one that should eventually get a
kernel driver, because prototyping in user-space in Python or
Javascript is probably easier than in C.
