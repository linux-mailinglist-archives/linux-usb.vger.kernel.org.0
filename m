Oh, I see. Indeed this sounds like the best minimal fix for the -rc and
backporting to stables. We may still want to get back to this at some
point and, potentially, split kick_transfer() into two parts that can
make assumptions about the context where they can be called.

Also, we may want to move the request to the pending list only if the
command succeeds. There should be no race condition as kick_transfer is
always called with interrupts disabled.
