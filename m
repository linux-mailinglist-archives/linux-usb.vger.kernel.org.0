What are the downsides? The way I see it there is not much difference. And =
this
way of handling things is feels more intuitive and flexible (overlays can
control what to enable easily, we can take advantage of the platform device
core).

Note that there are more users for this pattern: "raspberrypi,firmware-ts" =
and
"raspberrypi,firmware-gpio". Actually you were the one to originally propos=
e
this it[1]. :P

There already is a fair amount of churn in these drivers because of all the=
 DT
changes we did in the past, and if we need to change how we integrate these
again, I'd really like it to be for good.

We have no control over it, RPi engineers integrate new designs and new
firmware interfaces show up. This is a good example of it.

I proposed them to use SCMI as it covers most of what they are already
providing here. But no luck so far.

I see your point, it could be more monolithic, that said, having a driver i=
s
essential. See the reverts I managed to pull off at the end of the series.
