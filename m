My current test-case is video frames with 450kB on average at 30fps. This
currently results in ~10 CPU load for the threaded interrupt handler.
At least in my test, filling the actual video data into the frame has very
little impact. So if I reserve 900kB to support occasionally larger video
frames, then I expect that this CPU load will almost double in all cases,
not just when the video frames are larger.

Maybe I don't understand, how 0-length requests work. My current
understanding is, that they are queued like any other request.

If I want to reduce the number of interrupts then I need to queue more
requests and only ask for an interrupt for some of them. This means that
potentially a lot of 0-length requests requests are queued when a new video
frame arrives and this means extra latency for the frame.

I think the worst-case latency is 2x the time between two interrupts.
So less interrupts mean more latency.
The stop/start transfer this patch implements, the video frame can be sent
immediately without any extra latency.

I'm not sure how this is supposed to work. What exactly can the dwc3 driver
/ hardware do to handle a gap?

Huh, so how is this handled on other hardware? From what I can tell the UVC
gadget works with other drivers and I've not found any special handling for
this. Is there no packet sent or are 0-length packet generated implicitly
somewhere?
