No problem with that. usb-c-connector binding would just have to be extended.

I just don't see any need for these `vconn-en*-gpios`, because the control
is performed directly by the OCM firmware via GPIOs in the ANX7688 chip,
outside of the control of the Linux driver, and the driver doesn't even care
about the status of these pins. And if it will ever care, the status can be
read via I2C from the ANX7688 chip directly.

kind regards,
