No, we ran into this issue, but it was only seen in our mass device
testing.  I only made the changes to simulate the issue, so then I
wouldn't need to have to wait for the test results.

However, we did get a mass device test run in w/ the changes, and they
were unable to reproduce the same issues we've been seeing, so this does
fix an actual issue.

OK, I can try, but just to clarify, I was referring to how it was being
done in:

static void dwc3_ep0_xfernotready(struct dwc3 *dwc,
		const struct dwc3_event_depevt *event)
{
...
		if (dwc->ep0_expect_in != event->endpoint_number) {
			struct dwc3_ep	*dep = dwc->eps[dwc->ep0_expect_in];

			dev_err(dwc->dev, "unexpected direction for Data Phase\n");
			dwc3_ep0_end_control_data(dwc, dep);
			dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart(dwc);
			return;
		}

Correct, so the situation we're running into isn't technically something
covered in the flow chart, but it is a similar situation as the one it
currently highlights.

dwc3_ep0_end_control_data() does check if the dep->resource_index == 0
before issuing the end transfer.  The resource index should be zero if
there was no start transfer path executed.  However, I can add a check
here if that is preferred.

Yes, so maybe we don't need to explicitly stall and restart here, as it
will be restarted during gadget start.

Another solution we were considering is if we just avoid returning
-ETIMEDOUT even if there were pending transfers on EP0.  In the end, the
gadget stop routine would disable EP0/1, which would also stop any
active transfers as well w/ EP events disabled.
