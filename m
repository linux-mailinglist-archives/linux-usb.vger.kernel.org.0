In your v6.2 logs the usb bus numbers are interleaved, in the v6.1 they
are not. xhci driver registers two usb buses per host, one High-Speed and
one SuperSpeed.

in v6.2:

[    1.094679] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
[    1.094695] xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 2
[    1.096690] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 3
[    1.100549] xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 4

in 6.1:

[    1.071987] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
[    1.073300] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 2
[    1.076445] xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 3
[    1.082133] xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 4

0000:00:14.0 is your Intel xHC
0000:04:00.0 is your Renesas xHC

This change could be due to 6.2 commit:

4c2604a9a689 usb: xhci-pci: Set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS

Not sure why it would cause this regression, but worth testing it.

Can you try to revert that commit?
Or alternatively unbind and rebind the hosts from the xhci driver:

echo 0000:00:14.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
echo 0000:04:00.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind

(all your usb devices should now be disconnected)

echo 0000:00:14.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind
<wait a couple seconds>
echo 0000:04:00.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind

Thanks
Mathias
