There may be devices whose drivers are able to reduce power consumption
through some device-specific means when runtime suspending, even though
the device remains in PCI_D0.  The patch would cause a power regression
for those.

In particular, pci_target_state() returns PCI_D0 if the device lacks the
PM capability.

Thanks,
