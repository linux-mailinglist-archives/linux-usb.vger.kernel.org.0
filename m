Hi Felipe,

At least for EP0, I don't see us clearing the EP0 desc after we set it
during dwc3_gadget_init_endpoint().  In the dwc3_gadget_ep_disable() we
only clear the desc for non control EPs:

static int __dwc3_gadget_ep_disable(struct dwc3_ep *dep)
{
...
	/* Clear out the ep descriptors for non-ep0 */
	if (dep->number > 1) {
		dep->endpoint.comp_desc = NULL;
		dep->endpoint.desc = NULL;
	}

Is the desc for ep0 handled elsewhere? (checked ep0.c as well, but
couldn't find any references there)

I had a script that just did the following to trigger the soft disconnect:
echo "" > /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/g1/UDC
sleep 4
echo "a600000.dwc3" > /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/g1/UDC

Then on the PC, I just had a batch file executing adb push (of a large
file), in order to create the situation where there was a device
initiated disconnect while an active transfer was occurring.  After
maybe after 4-5 iterations, I saw that the controller halt failed.

[   87.364252] dwc3_gadget_run_stop run stop = 0
[   87.374168] ffs_epfile_io_complete: eshutdown
[   87.376162] __dwc3_gadget_ep_queue
[   87.386160] ffs_epfile_io_complete: eshutdown

I added some prints to hopefully show that while we are disabling the
controller, the gadget/function driver is still active.  The eshutdown
prints happen due to the dwc3_stop_active_transfers() call, which means
there are still some pending/active reqs.

Thanks
Wesley
