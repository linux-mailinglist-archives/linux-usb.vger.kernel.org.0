Why would a hub care?

But that's exactly what is needed here, if a hub wants to know what is
happening on a child device, it should just walk the list of children
and look :)

Combining counters is almost always never a good idea and will come back
to bite you in the end.  Memory isn't an issue here, speed isn't an
issue here, so why not just do it properly?

I can understand that for the device being "controlled" by a sideband,
but that's it.

Why "should" they?  They shouldn't really care.

You aren't notifying anyone, you are just incrementing a count that can
change at any moment in time.

I don't know, as I don't know exactly what you are going to do with this
information.  But as-is, you can't just go "let's put an atomic variable
in there to make it race free" as that's just not going to work.

But the driver that is "sideband" is bound to the interface, not the
device, right?  Or is it the device?

And again, nothing is being "broadcasted" here, it's just a variable to
be read at random times and can change randomly :)
