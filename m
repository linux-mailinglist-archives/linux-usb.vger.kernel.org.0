No, it doesn't in general AFAICS.

Generally speaking, for proper integration of system suspend with
runtime suspend at all levels, it is necessary to track whether or not
the given device has been suspended prior to system suspend.

In fact, there are even ways to opt-in for assistance from the PM core
and bus types in that respect to some extent.

In the particular case at hand though, the PM core is not involved in
making the decision whether or not to leave the devices in runtime
suspend during system suspend and it all depends on the drivers of A
and B.

Note here that the problematic situation occurs when the suspend of B
has run, but the suspend of A has not run yet and the transition is
aborted between them, so the driver of A cannot do much to help.  The
driver of B has a couple of options though.

First off, it might decide to runtime-resume the device in its system
suspend callback (as long as we are talking about the "suspend" phase
and not any later phases of system suspend) before suspending it again
which will also cause A to runtime-resume and aborting system suspend
would not be problematic any more.  So that's one of the options, but
it is kind of wasteful and time-consuming.

Another option, which I mentioned before, might be to call
runtime_resume() from the system resume callback of B (again, as long
as we are talking about the "resume" phase, not any of the earlier
phases of system resume).  This assumes that runtime PM is enabled at
this point for both A and B and so it should work properly.

Now, if the driver of B needs to do something special to the device in
its system suspend callback, it may want (and likely should) disable
runtime PM prior to this and in that case it will have to check what
the runtime PM status of the device is and adjust its actions
accordingly.  That really depends on what those actions are etc, so
I'd rather not talk about it without a specific example.
