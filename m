I think we are on the same page, but I don't think you can incorporate
the entry of the modes into the class itself (you should not do that).
You can't even make it a problem for the altmodes - I don't believe we
can make it work in the long term.

Here multiple modes need to be handled as a set, so the set itself
needs to have an object that represents it. The altmodes will be part
of these "sets", but they remain independent of any particular set.
So the "set" defines the order in which the modes are entered instead
of the class, or any individual altmode.

I don't think there is any other way to make sure that the altmodes
continue to work as well independently as part of these "sets".

If you guys think that this makes sense, let me know. There are a
number of ways we could implement this.

Races are definitely a concern. But I don't think that is a problem if
we go ahead with the above idea of separating the mode relationships
and entry into those "mode sets".
