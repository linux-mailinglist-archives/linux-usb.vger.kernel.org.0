But if you don't have a report, and don't have this device, how can you
test this to make sure?

Fair enough, but do it properly please.

What happens if the private_data pointer becomes "stale" right after
checking it is not NULL?  You need to explain how it is safe, if it is,
to do this.

Actually, what ever sets this to NULL?  I think this check isn't needed
at all from looking at the code (hint, think about the lifetime of the
file pointer...)

Unless you have the hardware to test this, I would not worry about doing
conversions like this.  I think I have this device somewhere around in
my "big box of USB devices", but testing any driver changes for it will
take a while before I can find it.

Actually, in looking at the code further, I think the lock is not taken
on purpose, so if you want to change this, you will have to document why
it is now really needed and what will happen if it is not.
