s/interrupts/SoCs in four groups/

And say something about the SS PHY interrupt being treated as optional
as there are SoCs with multiple controllers where only some supports SS.

As Krzysztof mentioned you should also add something to motivate why
this de-facto ABI breakage by reordering interrupts is justified and
safe in this case.

Try to use uppercase 'PHY' consistently in text throughout the series.

Capitalise 'Super Speed'

The description as it stands sounds circular. And this one is only used
for remote wakeup right?

s/phY/phy/

Perhaps rephrase to sound less like a commit message and to make it a
bit more concise.

But this is already an improvement over the current descriptions which
are too terse and not even correct.

I'm not sure about the free text description of these (format etc), but
at least this avoid repeating the descriptions for each permutation.

Perhaps the DT maintainers can chime in here.

I think you should reorder them to match the permutations below though.

You should not include the string "(optional)" here. It was only a
notation I used when we discussed this earlier.

The fact that these are optional should be expressed using min/maxItems
as I mentioned earlier. For the above SoCs that would be

	minItems: 2
	maxItems: 3

Perhaps you should align the continuation line here too.

Also have you set up the tools so that you can verify your bindings
before posing them? I assume the above wouldn't pass (e.g. due to the
"(optional)" strings).

There's some more details here:

under "Running checks".
