I think we should keep it like this, and have most platform specific
drivers be guarded in Kconfig like this. There are two main advantages
for this:

- Linus has mentioned several times that he does not want to
  be asked about new drivers that cannot run on x86 when doing
  'make oldconfig', and I'm fairly sure this applies to other users
  as well. Life is too short to know 19000 Kconfig symbols and
  whether you should enable them or not.
  Drivers tend to not be tied to an instruction set, so if a driver
  is used on mips32, arm32 and arm64, but is tied to a particular
  SoC manufacturer, it should only need to depend on that platform
  (|| COMPILE_TEST).

- A default config enables tons of device drivers, most of which
  are only ever used on a small number of SoCs. I like the convenience
  of being able to turn a generic config into one for my particular SoC
  by turning off all other platforms, and letting the platform specific
  drivers disappear because of the dependency.

There are two related points:

- For the specific question of drivers like DWC3_EXYNOS, I
  would indeed like to see fewer questions asked, and more
  of the customization done in a generic driver. The same is
  true for a lot of designware drivers (ethernet, pci, mmc, ...)
  and similar IP blocks from other vendors. We know these are
  all the same hardware design, just wired up in slightly different
  ways, but without help from the hardware designers we have
  no good way to come up with a generic driver that understands
  all the possible ways it can be wired up.

- I don't like the way we deal with a lot of platform specific irqchip
  and clocksource drivers. Unlike most other subsystems, these
  drivers just get selected implicitly from a platform specific
  Kconfig symbol. The main disadvantage is that this is inconsistent
  with the rest of the kernel, but there is also a more general
  problem with the use of 'select' that causes a couple of issues
  when used too much.
