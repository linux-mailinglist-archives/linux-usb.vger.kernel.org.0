Hi Alan,

the problem seems to be that we hitting HCI command timeout. So the firmware download is done via HCI commands. These commands are send to the transport driver btusb.c via hdev->send (as btusb_send_frame). This triggers the usb_submit_urb or queues them via data->deferred anchor. All this reports back the error properly except that nobody does anything with it.

See hci_send_frame() last portion:

        err = hdev->send(hdev, skb);                                             
        if (err < 0) {                                                           
                bt_dev_err(hdev, "sending frame failed (%d)", err);              
                kfree_skb(skb);                                                  
        }

And that is it. We are not checking for ENODEV or any error here. That means the failure of the HCI command gets only caught via the HCI command timeout. I don’t know how to do this yet, but you would have to look there to fail HCI command right away instead of waiting for the timeout.

Regards

Marcel
