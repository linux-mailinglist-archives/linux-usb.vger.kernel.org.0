I do not have a better idea how to fix described issue for Armada 3720
boards without touching other usb/core/hdc code. I wanted to put these
Armada 3720 changes only into xhci-mvebu/xhci_mvebu_a3700_init_quirk
code so it does not "pollute" other usb generic code.

This is not an issue as the usb core will later power on PHY during
initialization. So I can remove this line, it has no effect on
functionality.

Yes. If distributions which are running stable kernels (4.14, 4.19)
start updating their kernels to new stable versions (5.4+) then this
upgrade can break support for USB. Similarly for SATA and PCIe (already
fixed and backported to stable kernels). This is relevant e.g. to Debian
which stable version is on 4.19 and therefore is not affected by this
issue yet.

So my opinion is that such thing is a regression if kernel starts
depending on a new firmware version and cause malfunctions of some
subsystems.

Updating kernel on Espressobin or Turris MOX (both A3720) when using
Debian, OpenWRT (or any similar distribution) is relatively easy as
kernel is stored on SD card on rootfs filesystem. Package manager will
update it easily and can do it automatically (without user interation).

But updating ATF firmware is harder as it is stored in nand and on
Espressobin it is part of another M3 secure firmware image. I do not
know any distribution which can do it automatically, it needs to be done
by user.

Globalscaletechnolgies already implemented something in their kernel:
https://github.com/globalscaletechnologies/linux/commit/86fa2470c3a867ca9a78e5521a7af037617f5b3b

I do not like too an idea to depends on external RPC API in kernel.
I think that it is better to have native driver in linux kernel instead
of current RPC driver. Bugs in our kernel drivers can be fixed and
backported to stable kernels. But bugs in firmware we cannot fix and we
have to deal with them (in case we are using it).

I think that in past Linus said that Linux kernel does not use nor
depend on x86 BIOS routines/interrupts for similar reasons.
