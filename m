No force involved.

For some of us, it is 'just for fun' and the interest to understand the 
capabilities of those existing static analysis tools. To understand their 
capabilities and limits, we simply go through those warnings and try to 
reason if they are true positives (and deserve a patch) or false positives 
(which we at least try to reasonably document for later statistics and 
learning on systematic tool weaknesses).

Some others actually believe that the use of static analysis tools 
increase software quality and ONLY IF a static analysis tool is used, a 
specific level of software quality is achieved and they want to prove 
that the software reaches a certain level that way. (I do not 
understand that argument but some have been repeating it quite often 
around me. This argument seems to come from a specific interpretation of 
safety standards that claim to have methods to predict the absense of 
bugs up to a certain confidence.)

I am doing it for the fun and learning about tools, and I am not such a 
believer but those others would be forced by their beliefs until they 
understand what static analysis tools and their janitors really already 
contribute to the kernel development and where the real gaps might be.

I hope that helps to get a bit of the motivation. Consider us 
kernel newbies :)
