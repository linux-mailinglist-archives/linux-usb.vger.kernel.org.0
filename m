Just to clarify one more thing. The probe completion requirement came in 
because, before the device tree was flattened, dwc3-qcom and core are 
two different platform devices. And if the dwc3 core device probe got 
deferred, dwc3-qcom probe still gets successfully completed. The glue 
would never know when to register vendor hook callbacks to dwc3-core as 
it would never know when the core probe was completed.

That is the reason we wanted to find out accurate point where core probe 
is done to ensure we can properly register these callbacks.
