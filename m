I agree. And an application not configuring the required handshakes, but
still relying on them is an equal bug.

Any device with a classic old-fashioned RS-232 has probably already
solved this in another way or is accepted as not working on Linux.

And then there is also the device tree (overlay?) through which a quirk
like this can be communicated to the kernel driver. Not sure if this
could help for a plug-and-play device like on USB.

Personally, I would prefer the VID:PID to enforce the quirk and an
O_DIRECT (or other) flag used on open() as general backup plan. To
me a sysfs solution seems illogical.

Again, I agree.
