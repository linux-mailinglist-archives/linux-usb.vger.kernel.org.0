Couldn't you capture that ACPI/EC interrupt in kernel?

The build-in properties are not documented separately. I've always
tried to supply DT bindings for all new properties I've proposed.

In this case though, do we need the new property at all? Why not just
register a normal USB role switch on this platform? It can be either a
dummy role switch that only passes the user space input to dwc3, or,
perhaps ideally, it would also be a driver that captures that ACPI/EC
event/notification and then passes the information from it to dwc3.

thanks,
