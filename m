Hi Thinh,

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but when a function driver requests for
an endpoint using usb_ep_autoconfig(), most of the time it passes in a
FS descriptor that doesn't have the wMaxPacketSize parameter set (0),
which means it will probably fetch the first unused endpoint. (at least
this is what I noticed for the BULK ep cases)

In this case, it would be hard to determine if the endpoint selected
would already have the constraint you added factored in.

Definitely can agree to that.  We can make things a bit more flexible
depending on the system.  Maybe create a new property, and default it to
6 if "do_fifo_resize" is set, but this parameter is not defined.

Thanks
