So there is generic_handle_irq_safe(). It should get all the details
right like incrementing the counter in /proc/interrupts, doing nothing
if the interrupt has been masked or waking the interrupt thread if the
interrupt has happen to be threaded.
It triggers the interrupt so for a shared handler it will invoke _all_
registered interrupt handler and for threaded interrupts it will return
before the thread had a chance to run (free_irq() will handle it
properly and wait for the interrupt thread/handler to complete).

I see. Don't over complicate or "correct" things here. What should work
is that the removal callback can be called at any time and things
continue work. That means it will purge all queues, cancel all requests,
timers, whatever and free all resources associated with the driver/
device.

If it comes to PCI-hotplug you have to have a so called PCI-hotplug
slot. This "slot" will let the OS know if the hardware has been removed
or added. If you don't have such a thing you have to maintain the state
yourself by using the "remove" and "rescan" sysfs files of the PCI slot.

I'm not aware of any requirement for a PCI-driver to check if its device
has been removed.
