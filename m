Just use a mutex and integer (not refcount) to count the number of open
ports. Submit the urbs on first open and stop them on last close.

Not doing so, and instead submitting at attach(), means that the host
controller will be wasting power by polling the endpoints continuously
as long as the device is plugged in.

Sure you can do that.

No, the vendor driver tracks THRE per port
(ttyport[portnum].write_empty) and allows writing to more than one port
in parallel (e.g. releases the device write_lock while waiting for the
transfer to complete).

I thought the problem was that you could not submit another urb for the
*same* port until the device buffer for that port had been emptied?

This seems to be what the vendor driver is preventing.

Just connect a multimeter to the DTR and RTS pins and verify that they
are asserted on open and deasserted on close after issuing those control
requests (see ch9344_port_dtr_rts()).

I didn't mean that you need to support hw flow control (CRTSCTS).
