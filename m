Hi Dmitry,

Thank you for the patches.

What do you mean by transparent bridge here ? Bridges are a DRM concept,
and as far as I can tell, a PHY isn't a bridge. Why does it need to be
handled as one, especially if it's completely transparent ?

Can't device links help avoiding defer probing in those cases ?

Why so ? The PHY subsystem should provide a PHY, without considering
what subsystem it will be used by. This patch series seems to me to
actually create this DRM dependency in other subsystems, which I don't
think is a very good idea. Resources should be registered in their own
subsystem with the appropriate API, not in a way that is tied to a
particular consumer.

I'm not thrilled :-( Let's discuss the questions above first.
