In quite a few cases the middle layer has nothing specific to do in a
given phase of suspend/resume, but the driver may.

Subsystems haven't been required to provide callbacks for all phases
so far, so this change would require some modifications in there.

I actually prefer the core to do more, even if that means more
complexity in it, to avoid possible subtle differences in behavior
between subsystems.

The driver itself or the middle-layer may want to resume the device.

Arguably, it may do that in ->prepare() too, but see below.

Because another driver may want to runtime-resume that device in order
to use it for something before ->suspend_late().  Of course, you may
argue that this means a missing device link or similar, so it is not
clear-cut.

The general rule is that "synchronous" PM-runtime can be expected to
work before ->suspend_late(), so ->suspend() callbacks should be able
to use it safely in all cases in principle.

That expectation goes against direct_complete in some cases, so
drivers need to set NEVER_SKIP (or whatever it will be called in the
future) to avoid that problem.

Yes.

As per devices.rst:

"the driver must be prepared to
cope with the invocation of its system-wide resume callbacks back-to-back with
its ``->runtime_suspend`` one (without the intervening ``->runtime_resume`` and
so on) and the final state of the device must reflect the "active" runtime PM
status in that case."

Sure, if that helps. :-)

The difference is that SMART_SUSPEND allows the ->suspend callback to
be invoked which may decide to resume the device (or reconfigure it
for system wakeup if that doesn't require resuming it).  IOW, this
means "I can cope with a runtime-suspended device going forward".
[But if the device is still runtime-suspended during ->suspend_late(),
its configuration is regarded as "final".]

In turn, direct_complete means something like "if this device is
runtime-suspended, leave it as is and don't touch it during the whole
suspend-resume cycle".

These were exactly my original thoughts, but then when I started to
consider possible interactions the restore kernel (which also carries
out the "freeze" transition before jumping into the image kernel), it
became less clear.

The concerns is basically whether or not attempting to power on
devices that are already powered on can always be guaranteed to work.

POWEROFF is exactly analogous to SUSPEND AFAICS.

Because the former allows the driver to avoid providing a ->prepare
callback always returning 1.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

It is mostly. :-)

I will, but I need some time to do that.  Stay tuned.
