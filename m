I believe the genpd controller sits in CX, but among the domains
registered by the driver we find some that are subdomains of CX and some
that are subdomains of MX.

In the case Dmitry previously implemented, for the display, we have the
display domain controller sitting in MMCX and it exposes a set of
domains all being subdomains of MMCX - so 3652265514f5 ("clk: qcom:
gdsc: enable optional power domain support") simply adds all the domains
as subdomain of the controllers domain.

Here we would need to specify both power-domains and then make sure for
each registered domain that it is added as subdomain of the right one.

Hence the quotation marks around "problem", I don't see that we have a
problem, but it's something lacking in the current implementation.
