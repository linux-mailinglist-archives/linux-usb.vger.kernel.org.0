Oops...  Correction: pci_driver::remove _did_ get called, and the code 
in question is part of the remove handler.

Perhaps putting it there was a mistake.  At the time, I probably thought 
the problem was a general one which might affect all the PCI USB 
controller drivers, but looking back now, it might have been better to 
put in the individual device driver.

Perhaps that what we should do.
