just a drop in the ocean, compared to yours :-)

ok, so you can grab them at

http://fisica.unipv.it/transfer/usbmon_logs.zip

(they will be automatically removed from there in a couple of weeks).

For each size there is a .txt file (which contains the terminal
output) and 10 bad.mon.out_.... trace files. The file suffix "NonCanc"
means there has not been file deletion before copy; while "Canc" means
the opposite.

Each trace file name is identified by a timestamp that is also
referenced inside the txt, so if you want to get i.e. the 39-sec trial
for the 10MB filesize you have to open the ...10MB....txt, search for
the 39 seconds total time string ("Dopo stop trace: 39"), look at the
beginning of that trial, a dozen rows before, take note of the
timestamp, and open the corresponding bad.mon.out file (of course, if
there are more trials with the same time, you have to identify it by
counting its position (7th in the example above)).

To make it more simple:

$ seconds=39; size=10MB; grep -B14 "Dopo stop trace: $seconds" log_10trials_"$size"_NonCanc.txt

should show you more straightly the part(s) you need.

Thank you, didn't realize that :-) I will try it.

Thanks, and bye
