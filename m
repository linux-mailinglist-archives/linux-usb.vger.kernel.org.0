Yes, exactly.

I don't yet, but I'll prepare something. I did notice already that the
power supply class does not seem to display the suppliers nor
supplicants in sysfs. But we can always improve the class.

I probable should not talk about "hierarchy". Maybe taking about
simply "chain" of power supplies is more correct?

My idea is to utilise the "present" property with the ports. You would
always display all the possible supplies, but only the ones that you
expose in your current capabilities will be present.

The idea is also that the ports are always supplied by normal power
supplies of type "battery", "AC" and what have you. Those you can use
to see the maximum power your port can get, and to determine the
currently available power by checking the other ports that consume the
same supply.

So if you need more power for one port, you most likely will need to
attempt to adjust the power levels of the source PDO power supplies of
the other ports that share the base supply (like battery), or possibly
disable them, and that way enable (make present) more source supplies
for your port. That is the idea, but I admit I have not thought of
everything, so I'm not completely sure would it work exactly like
that, but the power balancing should in any case be possible with the
chain of power supplies one way or the other.

I hope I understood your question correctly, and I hope I was able to
give you an answer :-)
