We are saying that if you ship such a kernel, we _KNOW_ that it will
fail to work in a number of known systems.  I doubt you want that to
happen if you care about shipping a device, right?

Given that the USB-IF has explicitly kicked-out the Linux community from
its specification work and orginization, I personally don't really care
what they say here.  If you are a member of the USB-IF, please work with
them to fix the test to reflect real-world systems and not an idealized
system.  Last I heard, they wanted nothing to do with Linux systems at
all :(
