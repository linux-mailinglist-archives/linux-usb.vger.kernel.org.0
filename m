Ok, I'm confused.  This is not the first submission of this series, as
you sent out a v2 a few days before this one.

And am I supposed to suck in the chrome-platform branch into the
usb-next tree?

What should I do here, ignore these?  Merge them?

I see the USB change lost the reviewer's ack as well, why?

I'm going to delete all of these patches from my review queue now and
wait for a resend with some clarity as to what I should do with it :)

thanks,
