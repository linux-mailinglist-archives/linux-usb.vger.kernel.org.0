Thanks for being flexible.

I'm also open to the other approach, if you or others are convinced that a
platform device is a really bad idea.

Ok, I hoped we could get away with no USB driver at all, but I think it will
be needed to create the symlinks (on its own the platform driver wouldn't notice
when the USB devices come and go). Anyway, it's a relatively thin layer of code,
so it's not too bad. With the new binding the USB devices still should be able
to find the platform device if it uses the same DT node as the primary USB hub.
