devm_request_threaded_irq, of course if I set IRQF_SHARED | IRQF_ONESHOT.
As I remember it was EBUSY error.

I consult this with author of controller.=20
We have:
USB_IEN  and USB_ISTS for  generic interrupts
EP_IEN and EP_ISTS for endpoint interrupts=20

Both these group works different.
For endpoint I can disable all interrupt and I don't miss any of them.=20
So it's normal behavior.

But USB_ISTS work little different. If we mask all interrupt in USB_IEN
then when new event occurs the EP_ISTS will not be updated.=20
It's not standard and not expected behavior but it works in this way.=20

I thought that EP_IEN/EP_ISTS works in the same way.=20

I update driver according with this rules. I hope that it will work=20

No they are not reported in case of USB_ISTS register.
They should be reported in case EP_ISTS, but I need to test it.=20

It's only my guess.=20

I can't  come up with the right scenario now.=20

Sorry, I think that it was my mistake.=20

Ok, I think I understand.  So I have 3 options:
1. Mask the USB_IEN and EP_IEN interrupts, but then I can lost some USB_IST=
S
events. It's dangerous options.=20
2. Remove implementation of handling unaligned buffers and assume that=20
    upper layer will worry about this. What with vendor specific drivers th=
at=20
    can be used by companies and not upstreamed  ?=20
    It could be good to have such safety mechanism even if it is not curren=
tly used.
3. Delegate this part of code for instance to separate thread that will be =
called=20
   In free time.=20

In my opinion the third option is safest.  =20

Peter Chan explanation:=20
"
This un-aligned request buffer address for 8 occurs for Ethernet Gadget (eg=
, NCM),
it allocates socket buffer with NET_IP_ALIGN, so the last byte of buffer ad=
dress
is always 2. Although this can be workaround by setting quirk_avoids_skb_re=
serve,
but we are not sure if all gadget request buffers can be 8 or Max Packet Si=
ze aligned.
