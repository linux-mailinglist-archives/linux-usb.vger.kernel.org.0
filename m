Oops, yes, I meant type, not size.

Well, I personally try to use unsigned and the smallest integral type
that is acceptable in all the code I write - whenever possible.

What I had in mind was something like this:


// fill send_buf

retval =3D usb_transaction(...);

if (retval)
=09// dev_err(...), etc.

// process recv_buf if necessary


And that function would include the two calls to usb_bulk_msg(), and the
call to check_succes(). You could even write this function in such a way
that all locking is done only in that function minimizing the possibility
of locking related issues. But really, it's up to you.

What I meant is that even in this single module, the style is not consisten=
t.
I don't suggest you get rid of them, just that you use a consistent style.

Another thing, if you want to log a failure, then it should be
dev_err() or dev_warn() depending on the severity - in my opinion.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#printing-k=
ernel-messages
talks about kernel messages.
