Hi,

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack=20
your operating system. Currently I have gained full access to=20
your devices.

In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and=20
watching you for several months.
The thing is your device was infected with harmful spyware due to=20
the fact that you had visited a website with porn content=20
previously. =E2=95=AD =E1=91=8E =E2=95=AE

Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan=20
viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other=20
device that you own.
It means that I can see absolutely everything on your screen and=20
switch on the camera as well as the microphone at any point of=20
time without your permission.
In addition, I can also access and see your confidential=20
information as well as your emails and chat messages.

You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my=20
malicious software.Let me break it down for you: I am using=20
harmful software that is driver-based,
which refreshes its signatures on a 4-hourly basis, hence your=20
antivirus is unable to detect its presence.

I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the=20
scenes of you happily masturbating,
while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were=20
watching at that moment..=E1=B5=94.=E1=B5=94

All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and=20
messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on=20
your device or PC.
Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat=20
history.

I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.
Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent=20
0.000047 of 5,000 EUR to my Bitcoin account
(that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online=20
in case if you don't know how to do that).

Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet):=20
18eiQXQdF3WftbaxkNqNARMgb45mw7rr6W

Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will=20
proceed with deleting all those videos and also disappear from=20
your life once and for all.
Kindly ensure you complete the above mentioned transfer within 50=20
hours (2 days +).
I will receive a notification right after you open this email,=20
hence the countdown will start.

Contact me via email(techg00147@gmail.com and=20
mj3778682@outlook.com with subject:=C2=A0(012VIP-RESTOREKEYPC4102934)
After these steps you will receive through email the key and a=20
decrypt tutorial. 

Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.
If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will=20
straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

Good luck!
