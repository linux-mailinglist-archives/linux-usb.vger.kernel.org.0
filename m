The error is coming from the usbip host (server) which would have
stayed up  during client side reboot.

It requires an extra detach step before the attach. vhci client
doesn't do detach on it own. Attach and detach are user initiated.
So the current behavior is inline with that.

I don't dislike the shutdown use which essentially mimics
a series of "detach" commands from the user-space. However the
solution that works in conjunction with the usbip host side.

usbip_host - stub driver doesn't implement suspend/resume.

The problem here is that current vhci_suspend/resume are ineffective
usb core initiates usb_dev_suspend on the virtual device.

The solution could be to disable auto-suspend on virtual devices.
This would eliminate the suspend and resume hanging issue.

There is the server side issue - what happens when usbip host
suspends? We have a few components here to think about.

usbipd (user-space)
vhci_hcd and the usb devices it creates

usbip_host, stub driver that proxies between the device
on the server and vhci_client.

PM can be complex and it has to do lot more than it currently
does on both server and client end to support seamlessly.
