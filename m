So, I'm not greg, but... Motorola Droid 4 (and other phones) have USB otg controllers...
They can act as a device (common use), but they can also support USB host, and they
can power the USB bus... either with battery voltage or with 5V.

Having ability to control that even if USB device is not present would be pretty
interesting for various hacks.
