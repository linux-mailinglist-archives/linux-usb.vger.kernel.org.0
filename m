Right, I didn't have the full picture when listing all the pins of the anx7688.
I was not sure what should be listed.
I will remove that.

I will remove that.

Looking at the diagram in the schematics, I see that both vbus-supply and vconn-supply
come directly from the PMIC so similarly to the vbus-supply, the vconn-supply
can be part of the usb-connector. Then a driver can access the vconn-supply from the remote usb
connector. Is there a problem with that?

Thanks a lot for the review, I am not very familiar with usb and type-c, so your review helps a lot.
I will send v6 soon.

Thanks,
Dafna
