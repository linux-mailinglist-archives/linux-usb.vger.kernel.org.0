Which pci_update_current_state() do you mean, exactly?

Note that pci_platform_power_transition() itself contains one, which
triggers after a successful change of the ACPI power state of the
device (which should be the case here).

Then, there is one in pci_power_up(), but before that the device's
PMCSR is read from and written to in pci_raw_set_power_state().

It looks like the reads from it after the ACPI power state change are
all successful, but the write isn't unless there is the delay between
it and the former platform_pci_set_power_state().

That I agree with and the platform firmware doesn't compensate for
that (which it could do, arguably).
