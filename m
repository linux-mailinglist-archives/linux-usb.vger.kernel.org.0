This description is very confusing.  USB devices do not send interrupt 
signals to the host.  Do you mean that the device sends a wakeup 
request?  Or do you mean something else?

If the driver receives an interrupt, it is supposed to process the event 
even if the host controller is suspended.  And when ehci_irq() runs, it 
clears the bits that are set in the USBSYS register.

Why is your system getting interrupts?  That is, which bits are set in 
the USBSTS register?

This is a very strange place to add your new code -- right in the middle 
of the IAA and unlink handling.  Why not put it in a more reasonable 
place?

Also, the patch description does not mention has_synopsys_hc_bug.  The 
meaning of this flag has no connection with the interrupt status 
register, so why do you use it here?
