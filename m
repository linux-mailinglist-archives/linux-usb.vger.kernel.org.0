D'oh, I totally forgot about the case of changing sample rate here,
which is the new feature in Pavel's proposed patches.

I still think the existing behaviour is correct when the sample rate
hasn't changed.  But if the sample rate changes, maybe we have to force
the gadget application to reconfigure the PCM as the available sample
rate is now different.  And I guess changing the PCM state is necessary
in that case.

But I'd really like to avoid it for a gadget with only one available
sample rate (and ideally in the case where a gadget supporting multiple
sample rates is stopped and re-started at the same rate).
