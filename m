As I said in my response to Bjorn even if it is added to the kernel it
won't get to the official LTSes as it would be a new kernel feature.
New features aren't normally backported to the older kernels.

The algorithm is simple:
1) You know what USB controllers you have on your platform. They are
supposed to be compatible with snps,dwc3 string and have some pre-defined
base address.
2) Find all the files in the directory /sys/class/udc/.
3) Walk through all the directories in /sys/bus/platform/devices/ with
names found in 2) and stop on the device with matching compatible/base
address defined in 1).

In my case the strings could be retrieved like this:
USB_NAME_COMPAT=$(/sys/bus/platform/devices/1f100000.usb/of_node/compatible | tr '\0' '\t' | cut -f1)
USB_DEVICE_ADDR="$(head -c 4 /sys/bus/platform/devices/1f100000.usb/of_node/reg | hexdump -ve '/1 "%02x"' | sed -e 's/^0*//g')"
