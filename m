Ah, ok.  I think the incorrect usage of the API will result as a warning
as seen in Greg's compile log:

drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c: In function ‘dwc3_gadget_calc_tx_fifo_size’:
drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c:653:45: warning: passing argument 1 of
‘dwc3_mdwidth’ makes pointer from integer without a cast [-Wint-conversion]
  653 |         mdwidth = dwc3_mdwidth(dwc->hwparams.hwparams0);

This is probably why the page fault occurs, as we're not passing in the
DWC3 struct.  I will send out a V10 shortly after testing it on my device.

Thanks
