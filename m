Looking at the host driver I see that I need to fix it so that it
requeues the update if it fails (on SET_BUFFER or bulk out). Currently
it just goes back to sleep waiting for userspace to announce a new change.

I would like to avoid having a special case for retrying the failing
part of a bulk transfer for devices that only want full updates, I would
prefer to use the common error path of retrying the whole update.

This is my suggestion for the new flag:

/*
 * Always send the entire framebuffer when flushing changes.
 * The GUD_DRM_USB_REQ_SET_BUFFER request will not be sent before each
bulk transfer,
 * it will only be sent if the previous bulk transfer had failed. This
is done to
 * inform the device that the previous update failed and that a new one
is started.
 *
 * This flag can not be used in combination with compression.
 */
#define GUD_DRM_DISPLAY_FLAG_FULL_UPDATE	BIT(1)


Noralf.
