Thanks for checking this scenario. No surprises here.

It is an existing problem in the way vhci_hcd and the bound devices
handle suspend/resume. vhci_hcd suspend assumes once it returns
"don't suspend" the rest works. However suspend for the bound device
runs first and a subsequent resume on it fails.

This problem needs fixing - I don't know yet how to.

One thing I am curious about is the status of the bound devices after
"forced restart of the machine" when you see blank screen or hang?
