Another part of my purpose in doing this is that the vhci-hcd driver seems
should still retain suspend/resume hooks. Therefore, the faux bus should
add corresponding hooks to allow the driver to call its own pm functions.
Though currently don't know how to fix this problem yet.

That's an excellent question.Another persistent problem has surfaced 
during troubleshooting：
After a USB/IP device is bound to the vhci-hcd driver, when the machine
reboots or performs a forced restart(include resume fail,forced restart),
attempting to re-bind the device to the vhci-hcd driver will generate 
the error message
"usbip: error: Attach Request for 4-2 failed - Device busy (exported)".
At this point, the device must first be explicitly detached
from the usbip-host driver before it can be bound again.

I implemented a shutdown hook (can refer to the attached file) in the 
vhci-hcd driver
to perform vhci_hcd remove before system shutdown.
This resolves failures where devices cannot rebind to
the vhci-hcd driver after normal reboots. However,
it remains ineffective for forced shutdown/reboot scenarios
since no shutdown functions are executed in such cases.

That's all details I've gathered yet.
