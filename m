so far, so good... the usb congestion seems also to be gone... tried {usb m=
icro flash reader}->{disk}, {disk}->{usb micro flash reader}, {usb micro fl=
ash reader}->{usb micro flash reader}, all CPU 100% due to gentoo upgrade..=
. and the {bluetooth mouse} connected to the {bluetooth usb host} had no la=
g... before (2~3 years) I used the trackpad because it was soooo laggy or n=
ot even moving... so, there is something between  6.2.8 and 6.2.11 that did=
 fixed the issue.

sorry for the inconvenience, seems that just reporting the issue (that was =
annoying me for years) did fixed the issue...
this can be closed, thanks and regards
JLM
