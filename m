Good catch.

But with the 1/1 patch in place, 4 won't happen any more, right?  
sd_done() will see the resid from the successful read or write.

Exactly the same reasoning shows that usb_stor_Bulk_transport() also
does not need changes, doesn't it?  Which means that patch 2/2 is 
unnecessary.

PS: The correct term is "residue", not "residual".  I know that the 
code sometimes uses the wrong word.
