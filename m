The alternate driver in question here is vfio-pci, which allows IOMMU
protected userspace driver access to a device.  A primary use case of
vfio is to assign PCI devices to a VM, where QEMU is the userspace
driver.  An IOMMU group is a set of one or more devices that are
considered to be DMA isolated from other groups of devices.  DMA
isolation includes, for instance, the potential for peer-to-peer
between devices which cannot be managed by the IOMMU.  DMA between PCIe
functions within a multifunction slot are generally considered to be
non-isolated from one another unless they implement PCIe Access Control
Services (ACS) to indicate isolation.  I've never seen a USB controller
implement ACS, nor should they due to the interactions between
functions, therefore all the USB functions within a slot will be
grouped together.

The vfio framework will not allow users to access groups for which some
of the devices within the group are bound to active host drivers,
therefore in this scenario where we have one USB function bound to a
host driver and the other bound to vfio-pci, the user would not be able
to access the device and the vfio-pci usage of the device is
essentially nothing more than a stub driver until driver binding of the
other devices within the group changes.  IOW, vfio-pci is not trying to
make use of the device with this split binding, the report here is only
a fault seen in the process of moving all of the functions to vfio-pci,
which would then make the devices accessible to the user.

The IOMMU grouping restriction does solve the hardware issue, so long
as one driver doesn't blindly assume the driver private data for
another device and modify it.  I do agree that your solution would
work, requiring all devices are unbound before any can be bound, but it
also seems difficult to manage.  The issue is largely unique to USB
AFAIK.  On the other hand, drivers coordinating with each other to
register their _private_ data as share-able within a set of drivers
seems like a much more direct and explicit interaction between the
drivers.  Thanks,

Alex
