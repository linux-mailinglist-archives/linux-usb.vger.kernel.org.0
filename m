Sorry about that. I’ve added a comment to describe the symptom.

Yes, this is what happens here.

Runtime suspend routines are called successfully, so I think it’s still logically suspended.

Yes, the patch is to let the device stay at D0 and don’t run driver’s own runtime suspend routine.

I guess I’ll just proceed to send a V2 with updated commit message?
