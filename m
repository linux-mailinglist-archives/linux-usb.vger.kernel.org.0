Hi Rob,

Correct, I agree with that point, and in the changes uploaded, the QCOM
PMIC type C controller will be the parent node for the connector.

We probably wouldn't need to redesign it, but maybe if we can remove the
connector port assignments requirement, it would allow for some
flexibility.  From my knowledge, I don't think any driver is actually
utilizing or checking the port number assignments, so there isn't a
limitation on what could be defined in there.

Here's a simplified diagram of the FUSB302 reference design from the
data sheet.  The I2C bus is just for CSR access to the FUSB302.

				   _______		 _______
                            ______|FUSB302|		|SOC	|
			   |	  |Type C |		|	|
			   |      |Cntrl  |__I2C_______	|	|
			   |	  |_______|		|	|
 ___                       |       			|	|
|   |______ CC1/2 _________|				|	|
|   |______ HS DP/DM __________________________________	|	|
|   |							|	|
				   ________		|	|
|   |______ SS RX/TX1 ____________|FUSB304 |__SS RX/TX_	|	|
|   |______ SS RX/TX2 ____________|USB Mux |		|_______|
|   |                             |________|
|   |
|___|


Otherwise, we can just simply add another port definition for external
SS lane muxes if possible.
