Subject: [PATCH v3 0/1] dwc2: Enable USB when booted in ACPI mode

The BCM2711 has a designware USB controller that is commonly used
on the CM4 and RPi400. There is a desire to use thes machines with
a standard UEFI+ACPI stack as is being done with the normal RPi4.

This patch enables this by adding ACPI module boilerplate to the
existing dwc2 controller.

It should also be noted, that there is an ACPI table update
in the firmware which marks the ACPI _DMA() entries as
ResourceProducers. That change is required for this to work with
the 1G DMA translation present on the platform.

Changes:

  v2->v3: Add this cover letter to describe the patch changes
  
  v1->v2: Fix the kernel_ulong_t/set_parms() function typecasting
          warning by explicitly doing the type cast.
