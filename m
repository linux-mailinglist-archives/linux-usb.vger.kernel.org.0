Hello. My name is Panda Paul Magnus. I am a music producer, singer, 
front-end developer and part time writer. Having become unemployed due 
to COVID19, I spent my time writing a book (manuscript on: 
https://gogetfunding.com/7-and-the-11-heavens-book-publishing/).

It has turned out to be very good with my editor saying it wasÂ  "the 
best piece she has read in decades."

Consequently, I have been offered a publishing contract for my book "7 
and the 11 heavens". However, because I am a first time author, the 
publishers want me to demonstrate that I can generate the required sales 
before they can risk the investment.

They want me to get pre-orders of no less than 500 copies, but the more 
the better. I am sending this email to ask for help in pre-ordering the 
book, or making a donation toward the production cost of the book, to 
enable me take advantage of this once in a life time opportunity. Copies 
of the book will be sent to everyone who pre-orders as soon as it is 
ready in, give or take, 60 days. A full manuscript can also be emailed 
upon request in the meantime.

My GoGetFunding campaign for the book is on: 
https://gogetfunding.com/7-and-the-11-heavens-book-publishing/

I would truly appreciate any support I can get. Thank you for your time, 
and support in advance.
