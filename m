(I dislike very much this way of writing patch descriptions.  Unless
the reader has already looked at the email subject line and remembers
that this patch affects the mass-storage gadget, he will think the
sentence above is talking about command handlers in the SCSI core -- a
completely different part of the kernel.  When writing patch
descriptions, please do not assume that the reader already knows what
the patch is about.)

The return value is _not_ ambiguous.  If the value is >= 0 then it is
a data length, otherwise it is a status.  Yes, this is implicit, but it
is a very common pattern used throughout the kernel and everyone
understands it.

What is the reason for making this change?  Does it fix any problems
or prepare the way for any future patches?  It seems like this is
completely unnecessary.
